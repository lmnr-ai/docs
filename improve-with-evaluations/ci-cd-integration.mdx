description: Run evaluations automatically in pipelines
---

Use the Laminar CLI to run evaluations in CI/CD. Set your project key, call `lmnr eval` (or `npx lmnr eval`), and fail the build on quality regressions.

## Essentials

- Set `LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY` in pipeline secrets.
- Evaluation files must call `evaluate` at the top level (no wrapper needed). The CLI detects those calls.
- Use `--fail-on-error` to exit non-zero if an evaluation file is malformed (for example, `evaluate` is never called).  
- Use `--concurrency-limit` / `--batch-size` and port options when targeting self-hosted instances (see configuration parameters in `evaluate`).

## Example (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
name: run-evaluations
on: [push]

jobs:
  evals:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx lmnr eval --fail-on-error
```

For Python, install the `lmnr` package and run `lmnr eval --fail-on-error` instead.
