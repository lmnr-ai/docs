title: 'Adding data'
---

You can add datapoints either from file or by manually adding datapoints one-by-one.

## 1. Export from a span

You can export a span as a datapoint from both Traces and Evaluation traces. To do so,
select a span and click "Export to dataset" in the top right corner.

Select the dataset you want to export to and click "Export".

This will fill the `data` field of the datapoint with the input of the span and
the `target` field with the output of the span.

## 2. File upload

You can upload datapoints from a structured file with datapoints.

To do that, click "Add from source" at the top of the Datasets page. Then, select in the tab whether you want to upload in a structured or unstructured way.

### File format

Supported file formats are: `.csv`, `.json`, `.jsonl`. We infer the format based on the file extension.

- csv - **header is required**, default separator and minimal quoting are assumed.
If a row has an empty value or less values than headers, missing values will be filled with empty strings.
- json - the file must contain **one array** of datapoints.
- jsonlines - every line must contain one datapoint.

For each datapoint, we first construct the key-value object, and then parse it according to the following rules:
1. If keys are `"data"`, `"target"`, `"metadata"`, and `"id"`, we place them in the corresponding fields.
     - If we cannot parse `"id"` as UUID, we assign it a new random UUID.
2. Otherwise, all keys and values will go inside `"data"`.

If there is an error parsing the file, no datapoints will be added.
If a single value in the file does not conform to format, it will be silently ignored.

## 3. Add manually

Click "Add datapoint" at the top of the Datasets page and new empty row will be added.
You can any value as long as it is a valid JSON that contains a `data` field.
