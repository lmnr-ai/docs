## Overview

The queues view is a view to manually edit selected data. The data added to a queue
is either a span data or a dataset datapoint.

This helps create datasets with ground-truth data or human input.

A datapoint's `target` field can be manually edited in the queue and then saved to a **new** datapoint
either in the same dataset or in a new one.

## Usage

### 1. Create a queue

Go to the queues page and click "Create queue". Give your queue a name and complete.

### 2. Add data to the queue

You can add any span to a queue by clicking "Add to labeling queue" in the span view.

Similarly, you can add any datapoint to a queue by clicking "Add to labeling queue" in the dataset view.

### 3. Using the queue

Inside the queue, you view the datapoints added one by one. On the left side, you can see the existing
datapoint's content. On the right side, you can edit the datapoint's `target` field.

#### Navigation

- Use *Prev* and *Next* buttons to navigate between datapoints.
- *Complete* button will save the datapoint to the selected dataset.
- *Skip* button deletes the current datapoint from the queue.
