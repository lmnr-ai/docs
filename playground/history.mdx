The Playground automatically tracks all your runs, allowing you to review and revisit previous runs. You can access your history by clicking **History** in the playground interface.

## What's Included in History

Your playground history contains the same detailed information you see in traces:

- **Complete conversations**: Full message history including prompts and responses
- **Model configurations**: Which model was used, temperature, token limits, and other parameters
- **Tool calls**: Any tools that were invoked with their inputs and outputs
- **Performance metrics**: Response times, token usage, and costs
- **Timestamps**: When each run was executed
