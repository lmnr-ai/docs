Playground is an interactive environment that allows you to experiment with AI models, test prompts, and analyze responses.

## What is the Playground?

The Playground serves as a sandbox environment where you can:

- **Prompt experimentation**: Test different prompt variations and input configurations with instant results.
- [**Playground from span**](/playground/playground-from-span): Reproduce and experiment with exact configurations from any span by opening it directly in playground.
- [**Tool integration**](/playground/tools): Configure and test custom tools that models can call during conversations.
- [**Session history**](/playground/history): Access complete traces of all previous runs with full context and configurations.
