title: Iterate faster with Laminar Playground
---

Playground lets you tweak prompts, tools, and models using real trace context without extra wiring. Open any span, reproduce it, and iterate until it is right.

## What you'll do here

- Reproduce any trace span (LLM/tool call) in one click.  
- Edit prompts, models, and tool configs with instant feedback.  
- Save variants and compare outputs; keep session history for later.

## Fastest way to try it

1. Run the [Tracing quickstart](/tracing/quickstart) to generate a trace.  
2. In the Laminar UI, open that trace and click **“Open in Playground.”**  
3. Edit the prompt/model/tool settings; run and compare outputs.  
4. Save the best variant or push it back to your app.

## Key features

- **Playground from span**: jump in directly from any LLM/tool span with the original inputs and settings.  
- **Tools**: configure custom tools and test tool-calling models end-to-end.  
- **History**: every run is saved with inputs/outputs, tokens, and cost.  
- **Shareable**: copy a link to share the exact playground state with teammates.

## Build this next

- Open a trace and reproduce a span → [Playground from span](/playground/playground-from-span)  
- Add and test tools → [Tools](/playground/tools)  
- Review previous runs → [History](/playground/history)  
- Capture the trace that feeds your playground → [Tracing quickstart](/tracing/quickstart)
