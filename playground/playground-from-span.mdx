## Creating Playground from Spans

One of the most powerful features is the ability to create a playground directly from existing LLM spans in your traces. When you click `Open in Playground` from any LLM span, the playground automatically inherits all the original configurations:

- **Model settings**: The exact model used in the original request
- **Token configuration**: Max/Min tokens, temperature, thinking tokens
- **Images**: Image content also preserved
- **Tools**: Any tools configurations
- **System prompts**: Complete message history and system instructions
- **Input format**: The original prompt structure and variables

This eliminates the need to manually recreate complex configurations and allows you to instantly experiment with variations of successful prompts from your traces.
