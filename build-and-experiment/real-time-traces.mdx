description: Stream spans live while you build and debug

Real-time traces stream spans as they execute—no waiting for the root span to finish. They are ideal for long-running agents, chained LLM calls, and interactive debugging while you iterate locally.

## How it works

Laminar uses OpenTelemetry span processors. By default, batching optimizes throughput, which introduces a short delay before spans appear in the dashboard. Real-time mode switches to immediate delivery so you can watch execution step by step.

<Note>Real-time traces are available in Laminar Cloud.</Note>

## Enable real-time mode

Disable batching during development for instant visibility. Keep batching enabled in production for performance.

```javascript
Laminar.initialize({
  projectApiKey: process.env.LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY,
  disableBatch: true,
});
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Python">

```python
Laminar.initialize(
    project_api_key=os.environ["LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY"],
    disable_batch=True,
)
```
</Tab>

## When to use it

- Monitor long-running tools or browser steps in real time
- Debug complex agent flows without waiting for batch flushes
- Track progress for chained LLM calls during development

Switch back to batching when you deploy to minimize client overhead.
