description: Iterate on prompts and agent scaffolding with real-time visibility
---

Before you ship, you iterate. Laminar streams every span as it happens so you can debug long-running agents, refine prompts, and configure tools without waiting for batch processing or digging through logs.

- [Real-time Traces](/build-and-experiment/real-time-traces) show spans as they execute for instant feedback.
- [Playground](/build-and-experiment/playground) lets you test prompts, tools, and model choices without code, or jump in directly from any span (see the [Playground](/build-and-experiment/playground) page for how it works).
- [Local Development Setup](/local-development-setup) covers environment, CLI, and IDE rules that keep instrumentation consistent.

Coming soon: serverless infrastructure to run and test agents directly from Laminar.
