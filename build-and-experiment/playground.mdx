description: Experiment with prompts, tools, and models without writing code
---

Playground is an interactive space to test prompts, compare models, and configure tools before touching your application code. You can start fresh or jump in directly from any span.

## Core workflows

- Prompt and model experimentation with instant results
- Open a span in Playground to reproduce its exact setup
- Configure and test custom tools
- Review every run in session history
- Coming soon: roll out agents from state captured in traces

## Open a span in Playground

From any LLM span, choose **Open in Playground**. The playground inherits:

- Model settings, tokens, and temperature (including thinking tokens)
- System prompts and full message history
- Images and tool configurations
- The original prompt structure and variables

</div>

## Configure tools

Define tools the model can call during a Playground run. Each tool is a JSON object keyed by function name with a description and JSON schema parameters. Tool choice controls when a tool is invoked (`none`, `auto`, `required`, or a specific function).

```json
{
  "searchDatabase": {
    "description": "Search for information in the company database",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "query": { "type": "string", "description": "Search query or keywords" },
        "category": {
          "type": "string",
          "enum": ["users", "orders", "products"],
          "description": "Database category to search"
        },
        "limit": {
          "type": "number",
          "description": "Maximum number of results to return",
          "default": 10
        }
      },
      "required": ["query", "category"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Session history

Playground automatically records every run. History includes full conversations, model configuration, tool calls, performance metrics, costs, and timestamps so you can revisit any experiment.
