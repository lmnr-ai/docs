## Custom Chart Creation

Create custom charts by writing SQL queries directly. This gives you the flexibility to:

- Query your Laminar data with full ClickHouse SQL syntax
- Create visualizations that match your specific needs

## Getting Started

To create your first dashboard chart:

1. Navigate to the Dashboard section
2. Click the "New Chart" button
3. Write your SQL query using ClickHouse syntax
4. Configure parameters to make your chart interactive
5. Save and add to your dashboard

The next sections will guide you through creating and configuring dashboard charts.
