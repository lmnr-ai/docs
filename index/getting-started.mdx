# Index

Index is the SOTA open-source browser agent for autonomously executing complex tasks on the web.

* Powered by reasoning LLMs with vision capabilities
  * Claude 3.7 Sonnet with extended thinking (top performing model)
  * OpenAI o4-mini
  * Gemini models (upcoming)

## Local Quick Start

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install lmnr-index

# Install playwright
playwright install chromium
```

### Run the agent with code

```python
import asyncio
from index import Agent, AnthropicProvider

async def main():
    llm = AnthropicProvider(
            model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
            enable_thinking=True, 
            thinking_token_budget=2048)
    # llm = OpenAIProvider(model="o4-mini") you can also use OpenAI models

    agent = Agent(llm=llm)

    output = await agent.run(
        prompt="Navigate to news.ycombinator.com, find a post about AI, and summarize it"
    )
    
    print(output.result)
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

You can also run Index using the [command line interface](/index/cli) for an interactive experience.

## Use Cases

Index browser agent is ideal for:
- Web research and data collection
- Automated testing of web applications
- Content monitoring and summarization
- Competitive analysis and market research
- Customer support automation
- E-commerce operations

By combining the power of large language models with browser automation capabilities, Index enables you to perform sophisticated web-based workflows that previously required complex custom code.

## Next Steps

- Learn about the [supported models](/index/models) for the Index browser agent
- Use the [command line interface](/index/cli) for interactive sessions
- Explore [advanced configuration options](/index/configuration) for customizing the browser behavior
- Understand how to [stream agent output](/index/streaming) in real-time
- Set up [tracing and session replay](/index/tracing) for observability
- Use the [Index API](/index/api/getting-started) for serverless browser automation
