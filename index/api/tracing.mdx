## Tracing with Laminar

<Tabs>

    One of the most powerful features of using Index through Laminar is the comprehensive tracing and observability it provides. When you run browser agent tasks through Laminar, you get:
    
    1. **Full Session Replay**: Watch exactly what the browser agent saw and did during execution
    2. **Synchronized Traces**: See the agent's internal reasoning process alongside browser actions
    3. **Performance Metrics**: Track duration, token usage, and other performance indicators
    4. **Error Analysis**: Easily identify and debug failures or unexpected behaviors
    
    To ensure your browser agent sessions are properly traced, make sure you've initialized Laminar at the start of your application:
    
    ```typescript
    import { Laminar as L } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';
    
    L.initialize({ projectApiKey: "YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY" });
    ```
    
    All browser agent activities will automatically be traced and recorded in the Laminar platform, where you can access the session replays and analysis.

## Visualizing Browser Agent Sessions

![Browser agent session replay](/images/index/browser-session.png)

The Laminar platform provides a comprehensive visualization interface where you can:
- Watch time-synced recordings of what the browser agent saw and interacted with
- Follow the agent's thought process and decision-making
- Review extracted data and final outcomes
- Debug issues by identifying exactly where and why things went wrong
- Speed up session replays up to 8x for faster debugging

This visual replay gives you unprecedented insight into how the browser agent interprets and executes instructions, making it easier to refine your prompts and build robust web automation workflows.
