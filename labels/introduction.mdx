## Overview

Datasets can be used as data collections. One way to add data to a dataset is by
exporting spans from both production traces and evaluation traces.

To help you filter traces and export only relevant ones to datasets, you can add
labels to spans. Laminar provides you with a UI for labeling. This page explains label
types.

## Label classes

Every label on a span has a class. The class defines the name of the label,
and the possible values. For example `sentiment` can be a class
with possible values `positive`, `negative`, and `neutral`.

Every user can assign one label value per label class per span.

### Internal representation

Internally, each possible label value is represented by a number. This is helpful
to be able to add label values alongside evaluation scores.

### Creating a label class

When you create a label class, you will need to assign a number to each possible
label value. Make sure to use unique numbers for each possible label value.

For example, if you have a label class `sentiment` with possible values `positive`,
`negative`, and `neutral`, you can assign the numbers `1`, `2`, and `3` to each
of them.

## Label description

Label descriptions are optional and can be used to provide more context about the label.
We recommend setting them for better alignment between labelers, both human and
LLM-as-a-judge labelers.
