description: How to label spans from code
---

Sometimes you have some context prior to running a function and you want to label it at
creation time. For example, you may want to tag a span with the model provider
endpoint that you use, or the test dataset that you used to run the request.

Note that labels are not the same as metadata. Metadata is additional information about a trace
in a form of key-value pairs. Labels are used to categorize and filter spans, and they must
be created in the Laminar UI in advance. See [metadata](/tracing/metadata) for a more detailed
comparison.

## Label spans from code

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

This functionality is available from `v0.5.0`.

### Example 1. Labeling a span created with automatic instrumentation

```python
from lmnr import Laminar

with Laminar.with_labels(["my_label", "another_label"]):
    openai_client.chat.completions.create(...)
```

Note that any spans created within the `with_labels` block will inherit the labels,
including auto-instrumented spans or any calls to `observe`d functions.

### Example 2. Labeling a span created manually

```python
with Laminar.start_as_current_span(name="foo", labels=["my_label", "another_label"]):
    # your code here
    pass
```
Note that only the span created by this `Laminar.start_as_current_span` call will have the labels.
</Tab>

<Tab title="JavaScript/TypeScript">
This functionality is available from `v0.5.0`.

#### Example 1. Labeling a span created with automatic instrumentation


```javascript
import { Laminar, withLabels} from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';

// This can be both a function or an async function
await withLabels(["my_label", "another_label"], (message: string) => {
  return openaiClient.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: message }],
      // ...
    });
}, userMessageValue);
```
Note that any spans created within the `withLabels` function will inherit the labels,
including auto-instrumented spans or any calls to `observe`d functions.

#### Example 2. Labeling a span created manually

```javascript
import { Laminar } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';

const span = Laminar.startSpan('foo', { labels: ["my_label", "another_label"] });
// elsewhere
Laminar.withSpan(span, () => {
    // your code here
})
```

Note that only the span created by this `Laminar.startSpan` call will have the labels.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  Every label must have a string key and a string value. They must exactly match
  the name and possible values of the label class.
</Note>

### 3. Viewing labels

The labels will be visible in the Laminar UI, shown on each span as shields.
