New releases and improvements.

## December 17, 2025

- **Backend/Frontend refresh** — Backend deps raised (actix-web 4.12, aws-sdk-s3 1.118, prost/tonic 0.14 + tonic_prost build/codec); proto structs derive Eq/Hash. Frontend bumps (Next 15.5.9, NextAuth 4.24.13, @ai-sdk/react 2.0.116, streamdown 1.6.10) and unused app-server binary workflow removed.
- **Quickwit ingestion unified** — Single payload type for spans/events with index IDs; publisher/consumer simplified; better error logging; suppressed dead-code warnings on generated protos.
- **Query engine prod parity** — Python 3.14 base, nonroot container on Debian trixie, uv locked installs; validator strips SETTINGS clause to normalize queries; JSON↔SQL converters polished.
- **Always-on trace aggregation** — Aggregate traces flag removed—trace aggregation always runs. New ClickHouse `traces_replacing` table + views and manual backfill script.
- **Frontend cleanup** — Removed unused VNC/blog/checkout/tag/editor components/hooks; trimmed deps.
- **Events into Quickwit** — Events ingestion added; instrumentation around ingest/search to track errors/latency.
- **Stability and schema fixes** — Realtime stability, trace dependency removal, PostgreSQL schema tightening, RabbitMQ hardening, migration fixes and unused event clusters removed.
- **LAM feature work** — UI/data-path changes around LAM feature set.
- **Events + clusters unified** — Unified events and clusters data model/flows to simplify ingestion and querying.

## November 2025

- **Distributed realtime** — Fanout architecture for live updates across nodes.
- **Quickwit search shipped** — Query/ingest pipeline overhaul aligning ClickHouse + Quickwit.
- **Search UX** — Search & filter controls plus autocomplete for query inputs.
- **Auth separation** — Clear split between authn and authz in backend middleware/roles.

## October 2025

- **Security + UX** — Next.js bump for critical RSC CVE; frontend redesign sweep.
- **Schema & observability** — Trace aggregation toggles tightened; app-server observability v1 (metrics/logging); event definitions + triggers + settings UI/API.

## September 2025

- **Self-hosted query engine** — Packaged with runtime/config tweaks.
- **Sessions analytics** — Sessions table and UI views added.

## April–May 2025

- **Rust + perf** — App-server upgraded to Rust 1.85 (2024 edition) with dep cleanup; virtualized trace view for large traces; realtime updates for sessions.

## January 2025

- **Next.js 15 migration** — Next15 rolled across the frontend stack.
