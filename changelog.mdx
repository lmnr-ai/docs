- **Query engine prod parity (6ac991e6)** — Python 3.14 base, nonroot container on Debian trixie, uv locked installs; validator strips SETTINGS clause to normalize queries; JSON↔SQL converters polished.
- **Always-on trace aggregation (c3d66685)** — Aggregate traces flag removed—trace aggregation always runs. New ClickHouse `traces_replacing` table + views and manual backfill script.
- **Frontend cleanup (4f4d8f06)** — Removed unused VNC/blog/checkout/tag/editor components/hooks; trimmed deps.
- **Events into Quickwit (ae4a3b3b)** — Events ingestion added; instrumentation around ingest/search to track errors/latency.
- **Stability and schema fixes (be412d02 / 370e1ba2 / 8c21e4d6 / 6d55be4f)** — Realtime stability, trace dependency removal, PostgreSQL schema tightening, RabbitMQ hardening, migration fixes and unused event clusters removed.
- **LAM feature work (cc457274)** — UI/data-path changes around LAM feature set.
- **Events + clusters unified (24766df5)** — Unified events and clusters data model/flows to simplify ingestion and querying.
