description: Laminar is an open-source platform for observability and evaluations of AI applications.
---

- **Open-source** - Laminar is fully open-source and easy to self-host. Give us a ‚≠ê [here](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr).
- **Cloud** - Laminar provides fully managed cloud service for easier setup and scaling [lmnr.ai](https://lmnr.ai).

## Tracing

- Laminar tracing is framework-agnostic and based on **OpenTelemetry**.
- Laminar auto-instruments popular LLM SDKs and frameworks, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Langchain, and more with just 2 lines of code.
- Traces are sent via gRPC and processed by blazing fast Rust ü¶Ä backend, delivering extremely low-latency and high-throughput.
- Tracing of images is supported out of the box.

## Evaluations

- Evaluations are a way of tracking progress of your AI application. Without them, any iteration on your AI application becomes a guessing game.
- Laminar gives you powerful tools to quickly setup evaluations and efficiently run them at scale.
- All evaluations results data is tracked and managed by Laminar, so you can focus on building your AI application.
