See exactly what your AI agent is doing. One import. Full visibility.

Laminar is open-source observability and evaluation for AI agents. Add two lines to your code and every LLM call, tool use, and decision is traced automatically.

```python
from lmnr import Laminar

Laminar.initialize(project_api_key="your-key")

# That's it. Your OpenAI/Anthropic/LangChain calls are now traced.
```

[Get your API key](https://www.lmnr.ai/projects) and start tracing in under a minute. Self-host from [GitHub](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr) or use the cloud at [laminar.sh](https://www.lmnr.ai).
