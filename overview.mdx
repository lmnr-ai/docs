Laminar is an open-source observability platform purpose-built for AI agents. It traces every prompt, completion, and tool call, then helps you actually use that data.

**During development**, Laminar allows you to replay runs and use AI analysis to debug complex agent behavior.

**In production**, with Laminar you can define semantic events to monitor behavior and catch regressions at scale. Describe what you're looking for in natural language and track it across all your traces, so you're measuring real behavior, not just latency and token counts.

<Card title="Tracing" icon="route" href="/tracing/introduction">
  Trace LLM calls, tool use, and agent decisions. First-class support for **AI SDK, LangChain, Browser Use, Stagehand**, and more.
</Card>

<Card title="Evaluations" icon="chart-line" href="/evaluations">
  Run evals against datasets locally or in CI. Catch regressions before they ship.
</Card>

<Card title="Analyze" icon="magnifying-glass-chart" href="/analyze">
  Define semantic events to track behavior. Cluster similar traces and surface patterns automatically.
</Card>

<Card title="Datasets & Labeling" icon="database" href="/datasets">
  Build datasets from production traces. Label failures to drive iteration and regression testing.
</Card>

<Card title="Playground" icon="flask" href="/playground">
  Replay any traced span. Swap prompts or models and compare results side by side.
</Card>

<Card title="Platform" icon="layer-group" href="/platform">
  Full-text search, raw SQL access to all your data, and dashboards for exploring traces however you need to.
