Laminar is an [**open-source**](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr) observability platform purpose-built for AI agents. You can trace every call to an LLM, tool execution and custom functions.

Laminar goes beyond tracing and is deeply focused on helping you properly use captured data and extract insights from it:
- **During development**, Laminar allows you to rollout and replay agents from different parts of the captured trace significantly speeding up the development process.

- **In production**, with Laminar you can describe patterns and errors in natural language and track it across all your traces, to measure real behavior and user interactions with your agents.
