Laminar’s analysis stack helps you understand production behavior without leaving your observability data. Use SQL for deep dives, events and tags for quick classification, and online evaluators for real-time scoring—then layer upcoming AI analysis on top. If you’re new to any of these, the pages below explain what they are and how to use them.

- [SQL Query Engine](/analyze-and-debug/sql-query-engine) to query traces, spans, events, and evaluation data.
- [Events & Tags](/analyze-and-debug/events-and-tags) to label spans and capture custom signals for filtering and dashboards.
- [Online Evaluators](/analyze-and-debug/online-evaluators) to attach live scores to spans in production.
- [AI-Powered Analysis (coming soon)](/analyze-and-debug/ai-powered-analysis) to surface issues automatically.
