## Overview

Datasets can be used as data collections. One way to add data to a dataset is by
exporting spans from both production traces and evaluation traces.

To help you filter traces and export only relevant ones to datasets, you can add
labels to spans. Laminar provides you with a UI for labeling. This page explains label
types.

## Labels

Labels are simple tags that you can add to spans. They are used to filter traces
and export them to datasets. If you want to add key-value pairs to spans, use
[metadata](/tracing/structure/metadata) instead.
