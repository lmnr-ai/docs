Build dashboards on top of your traces, spans, events, and eval scores without extra infrastructure. Track costs, latency, accuracy, or any custom metric in a few clicks.

## What you'll build

- A dashboard tile showing the metrics that matter (cost, tokens, latency, accuracy).  
- Filters and group-bys to break down by model, route, user, team, or tag.  
- Shareable dashboards for eng/support/research.

## Copy/paste workflow

1. Open **Dashboard** → click **`+ Chart`**.  
2. Choose a visualization (line, bar, horizontal bar for rankings).  
3. Select a source (`spans`, `traces`, `events`, `evaluation_scores`).  
4. Define metrics (count/sum/avg/p90/p95/p99) and group by model/route/tag.  
5. Save to a dashboard and resize/arrange tiles.

<Tip>
Need a custom query? Use the SQL editor to craft it, then add the result as a chart.
</Tip>

## Example recipes

**Total tokens by model (identify spend hotspots)**  
- Source: `spans`  
- Metric: `sum(total_tokens)`  
- Group by: `model`  
- Filter: `span_type = 'LLM'`  
- Visualization: Line chart

**p90 cost by provider (compare pricing drift)**  
- Source: `spans`  
- Metric: `p90(cost)`  
- Group by: `provider`  
- Visualization: Line chart

**Top slow routes (find regressions)**  
- Source: `traces`  
- Metric: `p95(duration_ms)`  
- Group by: `route`  
- Visualization: Horizontal bar
