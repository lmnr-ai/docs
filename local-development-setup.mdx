description: Configure your environment, CLI, and IDE for Laminar
---

## Environment

- Set the project key once and reuse it across apps:

```env
LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY=your_project_api_key_here
```

- Keep the key in `.env` and load it in your runtime. Both SDKs read `LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY` automatically when you initialize Laminar.

## CLI essentials

- JavaScript/TypeScript: use `npx lmnr ...` after installing `@lmnr-ai/lmnr`.
- Python: the `lmnr` command ships with the PyPI package.
- Common local commands:
  - `lmnr eval` / `npx lmnr eval` to run evaluation files.
  - `lmnr datasets ...` / `npx lmnr datasets ...` to sync datasets.
  - `lmnr add-cursor-rules` to install IDE rules for Laminar patterns.

Run `lmnr --help` or `npx lmnr --help` to view all options.

## Cursor rules for AI-assisted coding

Use the CLI to install Laminar rules into Cursor (recommended):

```bash
lmnr add-cursor-rules
```

This downloads the latest Laminar rules into `.cursor/rules/laminar.mdc`. Reload Cursor for them to take effect.

Manual option:

1. Download `laminar.mdc` from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr/dev/rules/laminar.mdc`.
2. Place it in `.cursor/rules/`.
3. Reload Cursor and confirm the rule appears in **Cursor Settings → Rules**.
