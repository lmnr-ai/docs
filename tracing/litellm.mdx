description: Configure LiteLLM to send traces to Laminar
---

import LaminarInitialize from '/snippets/laminar-initialize.mdx';

## Default configuration

LiteLLM is well integrated with OpenTelemetry, so you only need to specify the
configuration through the environment variables.

<Steps>
<Step title="Set the environment variables">
```bash
LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY="<your-project-api-key>"
OTEL_EXPORTER="otlp_grpc"
OTEL_ENDPOINT="https://api.lmnr.ai:8443"
OTEL_HEADERS="authorization=Bearer $LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY"
```

<Note>
`authorization` must start with a lowercase `a`. This is different from
common HTTP headers convention.
</Note>

</Step>
<Step title="Enable otel callback in the code">
```python
litellm.callbacks = ['otel']
```
</Step>
<Step title="Run your code and see traces in Laminar">
<div style={{ border: '1px solid #2B2B30', borderRadius: '8px', overflow: 'hidden' }}>
  <img src="/images/traces/litellm.png" alt="LiteLLM trace" style={{ margin: '0px' }}/>
</div>
</Step>
</Steps>


## Using Laminar's features

If you want to use Laminar's features, such as sessions, manual spans, `observe` decorator,
you will need to initialize Laminar.

<LaminarInitialize />

This, however, will most likely result in your LLM calls being double-traced â€“ once by LiteLLM and once by Laminar.
To avoid this, you can disable automatic Laminar instruments at initialization.

```python
Laminar.initialize(instruments=set())
```
