## Overview

Laminar provides session replay for browser agents. Alongside your trace, you get a recording of the browser run synced with your spans (LLM calls, tool calls, and browser automation steps).

This makes it much easier to debug failed automations and understand why the agent took a specific action.

## Session replay for browser agents

Laminar traces LLM calls via auto-instrumentation, and records browser sessions via native integrations with common browser automation frameworks:

- [Puppeteer](/tracing/integrations/puppeteer)
- [Playwright](/tracing/integrations/playwright)
- [Stagehand](/tracing/integrations/stagehand)
- [Browser Use](/tracing/integrations/browser-use)
- [Skyvern](/tracing/integrations/skyvern)

In the Laminar trace view, you can scrub the recording and correlate moments in the browser with the spans that produced them.

### Privacy: masking inputs

If your agent interacts with sensitive forms, configure session replay input masking so typed values aren’t recorded.

## Getting started

<Tip>
If you don't have a project API key, you can get one by signing up on [Laminar](https://lmnr.ai) or spinning up a [self-hosted instance](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr) and getting a key from the project settings.
</Tip>

Follow the integration guide for your framework to enable tracing + session replay:

- [Stagehand](/tracing/integrations/stagehand)
- [Browser Use](/tracing/integrations/browser-use)
- [Playwright](/tracing/integrations/playwright)
- [Puppeteer](/tracing/integrations/puppeteer)
- [Skyvern](/tracing/integrations/skyvern)

## What it looks like

As a result, you will get a trace and a recording like this:

A more complex trace may look like this.
