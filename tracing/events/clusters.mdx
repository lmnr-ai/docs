title: Event Clusters
---

Clusters group similar events together to help you discover patterns, debug at scale, and detect anomalies. When you have many events (either [custom events](/tracing/events/events) or [semantic events](/tracing/events/semantic-events)), clustering reveals what's actually happening in your system.

## What Are Clusters?

Clusters group similar events together based on a value template you provide. When you start clustering, you choose what "similar" means—cluster by error message, by URL, by tool name, or by any field in your event payload.

Common patterns that emerge:

- **Similar failures** — Errors with the same root cause, regardless of surface differences (for example, 47 failures all caused by lazy-loaded content).
- **Behavioral groups** — Events that share a common action or intent (for example, all "search for product" events).
- **Anomalies** — Events that don't fit any cluster, surfaced as outliers worth investigating.

You control the clustering by choosing the value template. Laminar handles the similarity matching and keeps clusters updated as new events arrive.

Each cluster has a centroid (the "center" of the group in embedding space), member events, confidence scores, and automatically generated labels.

## Creating Clusters

To cluster a semantic event definition:

<Frame caption="Starting clustering for a semantic event definition">
  <img src="/images/start-clustering.png" alt="Start Clustering dialog with value template input" />
</Frame>

1. In **Events**, click your event definition to open it.
2. Click **Start Clustering**.
3. Choose a **Value Template** (Mustache-like) that represents what "similar" means for this event (for example, cluster by an error message, URL, tool name, or other payload field).
4. Click **Start**, then switch to **Clusters** to see grouped results.

## How Clustering Works

When you start clustering, Laminar evaluates your **Value Template** (Mustache-like) for each event and uses the resulting value as the primary grouping signal.

As new events arrive, clusters continuously update and stay current, so you can track emerging patterns and regressions over time.

## What You Can Do With Clusters

**Understand user behavior** — See what users are actually trying to accomplish, not just what buttons they clicked. Intent clusters reveal the "why" behind actions.

**Debug at scale** — When something breaks, find all similar failures instantly. One fix addresses an entire cluster of issues.

**Detect anomalies** — Unusual patterns surface automatically. Spot problems before users report them.

**Track trends** — See how behavior changes over time. New clusters emerging? Old patterns disappearing?

**Build datasets** — Export clusters as evaluation datasets. Test your agent against real-world patterns, not synthetic examples.

## Viewing Clusters

In the Laminar dashboard:

1. Go to **Events** to see the raw event stream
2. Switch to **Clusters** to see grouped patterns
3. Click any cluster to see its members, centroid, labels, and confidence score
4. Filter by time range, event type, or cluster label
5. Export cluster members to a dataset for evaluation

## Example: Finding Extraction Failures

Your browser agent extracts product data. Some extractions fail. Instead of searching through logs:

1. Filter events to `extraction.failed`
2. View clusters—Laminar groups failures by similarity
3. One cluster shows 47 failures, all on sites with lazy-loaded content
4. Another cluster shows 12 failures, all with the same malformed selector
5. Fix each root cause once, verify with the cluster members

## Best Practices

**Let clusters emerge** — Don't over-specify upfront. Run your agent, observe what clusters form, then decide which patterns matter.

**Use clusters for evaluation** — When you find a problematic cluster, export it as a dataset. Run evaluations against it. Measure improvement.

**Monitor cluster health** — Watch for new clusters appearing (new failure modes?) or existing clusters growing rapidly (regression?).

**Combine with SQL** — Query cluster metadata in the SQL editor. Find your largest clusters, newest clusters, or clusters with specific labels.
