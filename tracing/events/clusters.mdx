title: Signal Clusters
---

Clusters group similar **signal events** together to help you discover patterns and debug at scale. Clustering applies to LLM signals (signal events), not span events emitted from code.

## What Are Clusters?

Every signal event has a `payload` field containing JSON data. Clusters group events by extracting a string value from this JSON using a simple Mustache-style template (top-level keys only), then grouping events with similar extracted values.

For example, if your events have payloads like `{"error_message": "Connection timeout", "url": "..."}`, you can cluster by `{{error_message}}` to group similar errors together.

Common patterns that emerge:

- **Similar failures** - Errors with the same root cause, regardless of surface differences (for example, 47 failures all caused by lazy-loaded content).
- **Behavioral groups** - Events that share a common action or intent (for example, all "search for product" events).

You control clustering by defining a Mustache template that extracts the value to cluster on. Laminar renders the template and sends the extracted content to the clustering service, which groups similar events and names clusters.

## Set up clustering

1. In **Signals**, click your signal to open it.
2. In the **Events** tab, click **Start Clustering**.
3. Enter a **Value Template** - a Mustache string like `{{content}}` or `{{error_message}}` that extracts the value to cluster on from the event's `payload` JSON. (Only top-level keys like `error_message` are supported.)
4. Click **Start** to populate the clusters table.

## How Clustering Works

Every signal event stores its data in a `payload` JSON field. When you start clustering:

1. Laminar renders your Mustache template against each event's `payload` JSON (top-level keys only)
2. The template extracts a string value (for example, `{{content}}` pulls the `content` field)
3. Laminar sends the extracted content to the clustering service, which assigns/updates clusters

As new signal events arrive, Laminar sends them for clustering so the cluster view can stay current.

## What You Can Do With Clusters

**Understand user behavior** - See what users are actually trying to accomplish, not just what buttons they clicked. Intent clusters reveal the "why" behind actions.

**Debug at scale** - When something breaks, find all similar failures instantly. One fix addresses an entire cluster of issues.

**Spot unusual patterns** - Unusual clusters can stand out when you scan the grouped events.

**Track trends** - See how behavior changes over time. New clusters emerging? Old patterns disappearing?

## Viewing Clusters

In the Laminar dashboard:

1. Go to **Signals** and open your signal.
2. In the **Events** tab, use the **Clusters** table to see grouped patterns.
3. Click a cluster name to open the events list filtered by that cluster.

## Example: Finding Extraction Failures

Your browser agent extracts product data. Some extractions fail. Each `extraction.failed` event has a `payload` like:

```json
{
  "error_message": "Element not found: .product-price",
  "url": "https://shop.example.com/item/123",
  "selector": ".product-price"
}
```

Instead of searching through logs:

1. Start clustering with the template `{{error_message}}`
2. View clusters to see failures grouped by similar error messages
3. One cluster shows 47 failures, all on sites with lazy-loaded content
4. Another cluster shows 12 failures, all with the same malformed selector
5. Fix each root cause once, verify with the cluster members
