title: Emit custom events from code
---

Custom events are lightweight annotations you emit from your code. They are stored as span events (the `events` table) and show up in the span **Events** view. They do **not** create Signals or appear in the Signals list.

Unlike spans (which represent units of work), custom events are useful for:

- Tracking outcomes and key checkpoints
- Adding structured metadata for later SQL queries
- Creating high-signal analytics without parsing span inputs/outputs

## Emitting custom events

Emit events from inside a span context (for example, inside `observe()` / an `@observe`d function) so the event attaches to the correct trace. If you call `Laminar.event` outside of a span, Laminar creates a span and attaches the event to it.

    import { Laminar, observe } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';

    await observe({ name: 'extractProduct' }, async () => {
      // ... your logic ...

      Laminar.event({
        name: 'extraction.completed',
        attributes: {
          url: 'https://example.com/product/123',
          fields_extracted: 12,
          duration_ms: 847,
        },
      });
    });
    ```

                "url": "https://example.com/product/123",

## Best practices

- Keep event `name` values stable and low-cardinality (don't include request IDs).
- Put details into `attributes` (and avoid sensitive data).
- Emit events inside a span context so they attach to the correct trace.

## Viewing custom events

In the Laminar UI:

- Open a trace, select a span, and view its **Events** tab.
- Query custom events in the [SQL Editor](/platform/sql-editor) using the `events` table.

If you want LLM-extracted signals, see [LLM Signals](/tracing/events/semantic-events).
