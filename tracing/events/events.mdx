title: Emit events from code
---

Custom events are structured signals you emit from your code to mark important domain-specific actions, decisions, or outcomes (for example, `extraction.completed`, `checkout.failed`, `handoff_to_human`).

Unlike spans (which represent units of work), custom events are lightweight annotations you can use for:

- Filtering and clustering runs by what happened
- Tracking outcomes and key checkpoints
- Creating high-signal analytics without parsing span inputs/outputs

## Emitting custom events

Emit events from inside a span context (for example, inside `observe()` / an `@observe`d function) so the event attaches to the correct trace.

        name: 'extraction.completed',
        attributes: {
          url: 'https://example.com/product/123',
          fields_extracted: 12,
          duration_ms: 847,

## Best practices

- Keep event `name` values stable and low-cardinality (don’t include request IDs).
- Put details into `attributes` (and avoid sensitive data).
- Emit events inside a span context so they attach to the correct trace.

## Viewing events

In the Laminar UI, open **Events** to browse and filter event streams.

You can also:
- Extract events from traces automatically with [Semantic Events](/tracing/events/semantic-events)
- Group similar events together with [Clusters](/tracing/events/clusters)
- Query custom events in the [SQL Editor](/platform/sql-editor) using the `events` table
