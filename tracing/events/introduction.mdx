Signals are the outcomes, behaviors, and failures you want to track. Each signal is stored as a signal event tied to a trace, so you can jump back to trace context.

Signals are generated from trace data by Laminar's internal AI agent (LLM signals). Custom events emitted from your code (via `Laminar.event`) are stored as span events and are not associated with a signal.

Signals also support two execution modes:

- backfill jobs on historical traces
- live triggers for new traces
