Events are things that happened in your system that are worth recording. Each event is associated with a span and its corresponding trace.

In Laminar, events help you understand what's happening in your AI applications beyond just tracing. You can set up events to track: user actions, business outcomes, errors, state changes, or any signal that matters to your product.
