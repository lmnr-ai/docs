Signals are the outcomes, behaviors, and failures you want to track. Each signal is stored as an event attached to a span and its trace, so you can always jump back to full context.

Signals are the new home for Events. Any custom events you already emit show up as signals automatically.

Signals unify two sources of truth:

- custom events emitted from your code
- LLM-extracted signals from trace data

Signals also support two execution modes:

- backfill jobs on historical traces
- live triggers for new traces
