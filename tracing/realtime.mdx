sidebarTitle: Real-time Traces
title: Monitor and debug traces in real-time as they're being executed
---

## Overview

Real-time traces are one of Laminar's most powerful features, allowing you to see spans as they're being executed without waiting for the top-level span to complete. This provides immediate visibility into trace data during development and debugging processes, which is especially valuable when:

- Working with long-running operations
- Debugging complex agent interactions
- Monitoring multiple chained LLM requests
- Testing a system in development

## How It Works

Laminar uses [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) for trace collection and processing. By default, it uses `BatchSpanProcessor`, which buffers and sends traces in batches to optimize performance:

- Traces are collected and stored temporarily on the client side
- Data is sent periodically to the Laminar backend
- There's a small delay between span completion and dashboard visibility
- The delay depends on batch configuration (flush interval and batch size)

<Note>
Real-time traces are currently available only in the Laminar cloud platform.

## Disable Batching (Optional)

For immediate trace visibility, you can disable batching by setting `disableBatch` to `true` in the `Laminar.initialize` function:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript/Typescript">
```javascript
Laminar.initialize({
    // ... other options
    disableBatch: true,
});
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Python">
```python
Laminar.initialize(
    # other options
    disable_batch=True,
)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

This configuration uses `SimpleSpanProcessor`, which processes and sends traces immediately.

### Performance Considerations

- **Development**: Real-time processing provides immediate feedback, beneficial for debugging and development workflows
- **Production**: Batch processing is recommended for better performance and resource utilization

<Note>
While real-time traces provide immediate visibility, disabling batching may impact application performance in production environments.
</Note>

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Feedback**: See traces as they happen, without waiting for operations to complete
2. **Faster Debugging**: Identify issues in real-time without waiting for batched processing
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Track long-running operations as they execute
4. **Enhanced Development Experience**: Test and iterate more quickly with instant visibility
