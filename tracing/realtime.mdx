title: "Realtime tracing"
---

It is useful when debugging or developing to view traces in realtime.

This is especially relevant for larger agents that make many requests to LLMs and take a while to run.

## Introduction

Laminar uses [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to trace requests.

By default, we use the `BatchSpanProcessor` from OpenTelemetry, which is an object on the client side (where your code runs) that
buffers spans and sends them in batches to the Laminar backend.

This means that there is some delay between when a span is finished and when it is visible in the Laminar dashboard based on the
configuration of the `BatchSpanProcessor` (usually interval between flushes and the limit of spans in a batch).

## Enable realtime tracing

To enable realtime tracing, you can use the `disableBatch` option in the `Laminar.initialize` function.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript/Typescript">
```javascript
Laminar.initialize({
    // ... other options
    disableBatch: true,
});
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Python">
```python
Laminar.initialize(
    # other options
    disable_batch=True,
)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>


This will use `SimpleSpanProcessor` instead which sends the spans to the Laminar backend immediately.

<Warning>
This is not recommended for production environments as it may impact the performance of your application.
