## Default automatic tracing

If you initialize Laminar, LLM calls will be automatically traced.
Typically, one LLM call creates one span.

<div style={{ border: '1px solid #2B2B30', borderRadius: '8px', overflow: 'hidden' }}>
  <img src="/images/traces/trace-openai.png" alt="OpenAI span" style={{ margin: '0px' }}/>
</div>

Here, `openai.chat` is a span. It is the only span in the trace.

Since these spans are created automatically, they are not grouped into traces.
That is, you will see one span per trace.

For example, in this toy application, we make two LLM calls – first generates 
random nouns, and second generates a poem using those nouns.

<div style={{ border: '1px solid #2B2B30', borderRadius: '8px', overflow: 'hidden' }}>
  <img src="/images/traces/ungrouped-spans.png" alt="Ungrouped spans" style={{ margin: '0px' }}/>
</div>

Here, both entries in the table are traces. Each trace contains one span.
On the right-hand side, you can see the expanded view of the trace. It shows
the only span `openai.chat`.

It will make sense to group these spans into a single trace, as they belong to the same user request.

## Grouping spans into traces

The most common way to group spans into traces is to create one parent span before making LLM calls.
This parent span will contain all the child spans, each may be an LLM call, or a piece of code that you want to trace.

The concept of such a parent span is sometimes called a "root span" or a "top-level span".

The recommended way to create a parent span is to use the `observe` decorator (Python)
or `observe` function wrapper (JavaScript/TypeScript).

## Grouping traces into sessions

Sometimes, you may want to group traces into sessions. 
Sessions are useful when you want to group traces that are related to a single user interaction or a single request.

For example, imagine an advanced conversational chatbot agent that at every turn in the conversation
does several things, such as processing the user input, calling the database, and generating a response.
In such case, we may want to represent each turn in the conversation as a trace, and the whole conversation as a session.

### Example. Associate a trace with a session

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

Simply call the `Laminar.set_session(session_id="session123")` within or outside any span context.
All the subsequent spans will be associated with the session.

```python
from lmnr import Laminar, observe

Laminar.initialize(project_api_key=os.environ["LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY"])

@observe()
def my_function():
    Laminar.set_session(session_id="session123")
    # your code here

    # optionally, at the end of the session, you can clear the session id
    Laminar.clear_session()
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="JavaScript/TypeScript">

Use the `Laminar.withSession` wrapper function to create a context with a sessionId.
All the spans within the wrapper will be associated with the session.

```javascript
import { Laminar } from "@lmnr-ai/lmnr";
import { context as contextApi } from '@opentelemetry/api';

const context = Laminar.withSession({ sessionId: "session123"}, () => {
    // Your code here
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Viewing sessions

Head to the traces page and select the "Sessions" tab. You will see all the sessions,
and if you click on each, it will expand to show all the traces within the session.

<div style={{ border: '1px solid #2B2B30', borderRadius: '8px', overflow: 'hidden' }}>
  <img src="/images/traces/sessions.png" alt="Sessions" style={{ margin: '0px' }}/>
</div>

Each trace within a session is the same as if it were a standalone trace.

<div style={{ border: '1px solid #2B2B30', borderRadius: '8px', overflow: 'hidden' }}>
  <img src="/images/traces/trace-in-session.png" alt="A trace in a session" style={{ margin: '0px' }}/>
</div>

## Dynamically disabling tracing

Sometimes, you may want to dynamically disable tracing for a particular span.
For example, some of your customers need more privacy than others, and you only
want to collect metadata for some of them.

To achieve this, we offer a wrapper that can set tracing to one of the following modes:
- `ALL` – trace everything as normal
- `META_ONLY` – do not trace inputs and outputs
- `OFF` – do not trace anything within the wrapper

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript/TypeScript">
```javascript
// only available since v0.4.25
import { withTracing, TracingLevel } from "@lmnr-ai/lmnr";

withTracing(TracingLevel.OFF, () => {
    // your code here
});

// code here is traced normally
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">
```python
# only available since v0.4.45
from lmnr import Laminar, TracingLevel

with Laminar.set_tracing_level(TracingLevel.OFF):
    # your code here
    pass

# code here is traced normally
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
