Tracing records what your agent does (LLM calls, tool use, and control flow) so you can debug individual runs and understand behavior over time.

Tracing is also the entry point into Laminar: it’s how production runs become data in the platform. Once you’re tracing, you can use [Platform](/platform) tools to explore traces, turn real failures into [Datasets](/datasets), and run comprehensive [Evaluations](/evaluations).

## Where to Start

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Integrations" href="/tracing/integrations/overview">
    You’re already using supported libraries. Learn what’s captured and how to configure instrumentation (including Browser Use and Stagehand).
  </Card>

  <Card title="Tracing Structure" href="/tracing/structure/overview">
    You want deeper visibility into your own code. Trace your functions, create manual spans, add context, and control what’s captured.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Troubleshooting" href="/tracing/troubleshooting">
    You’re not seeing what you expect. Debug missing spans, auto-instrumentation issues, and common setup pitfalls.
