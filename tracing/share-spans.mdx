You can share a trace publicly and embed the full Laminar trace viewer directly in blog posts, docs, or any other MDX content. Spans inherit the same visibility, so a public trace makes every span in it embeddable.

## How it works

1. Open a trace and click **Share** (globe icon).
2. Set the trace visibility to **Public**.
3. Copy the share link (or the MDX embed snippet if you're editing a Laminar blog/doc).

Use the `<Trace>` MDX component to render the full trace viewer inline. Optionally include `spanId` to preselect a span:

```mdx
<Trace id="TRACE_ID" spanId="SPAN_ID" host="https://laminar.sh" />
```

If you're writing docs in this repo, you can import the helper component directly:

```mdx
import Trace from "/snippets/Trace";

<Trace id="TRACE_ID" spanId="SPAN_ID" host="https://laminar.sh" />
```

Embeds are only supported from the Laminar domain (no cross-origin CORS needed). A preview without live data looks like this:

<Trace previewOnly id="trace-id" spanId="span-id" host="https://laminar.sh" />

## Example: live embed from a shared trace

Below is a working embed against a local Laminar instance. Swap `host` for your own domain (e.g., `https://laminar.sh`) and replace `id`/`spanId` with values from the trace share dialog.

<Trace id="93745aae-90d5-4a10-8845-5705b8520f72" spanId="128282b5-5554-482a-9528-cf982e750f58" host="http://localhost:3000" />
