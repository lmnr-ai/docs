# Events & Clusters

When you're running agents at scale, you can't look at every trace. Events and clusters let you see patterns across thousands of runs—what's working, what's failing, and why.

---

## Example: Debugging Extraction Failures

Your browser agent extracts product data from e-commerce sites. Some extractions fail. You could search through traces one by one, or:

1. Go to **Events** in the dashboard and filter to `extraction.failed`
2. Switch to **Clusters**—Laminar groups similar failures together
3. You see two clusters:
   - **47 failures** on sites with lazy-loaded content (the extractor runs before content appears)
   - **12 failures** with the same malformed CSS selector
4. Fix each root cause once. Verify against the cluster members.

Two fixes. Fifty-nine failures resolved.

## Events

An event is a structured record of something that happened in your agent—an action, a decision, a state change.

```json
{
  "type": "extraction.completed",
  "session_id": "sess_abc123",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:23:45Z",
  "payload": {
    "url": "https://example.com/product/123",
    "fields_extracted": 12,
    "duration_ms": 847
  }
}
```

Laminar captures events automatically from your traces. You can also emit custom events for domain-specific actions.

Events are append-only—once recorded, they don't change. You build understanding by analyzing patterns across events, not by modifying them.

---

## Clusters

Clusters group similar events together. Instead of thousands of individual events, you see patterns.

Laminar clusters events by similarity. Events that look alike—same error message, same user intent, same failure mode—end up in the same cluster. Each cluster gets an auto-generated label describing what the events have in common.

### What You Can Do With Clusters

**Debug at scale.** When something breaks, find all similar failures instantly. One fix addresses an entire cluster.

**Understand user intent.** See what users are actually trying to accomplish, not just what buttons they clicked. Events with similar goals cluster together even if the surface actions differ.

**Detect anomalies.** Unusual patterns surface automatically. New cluster appearing? Something changed. Cluster growing rapidly? Possible regression.

**Build evaluation datasets.** Export a cluster as a dataset. Test your agent against real-world failure patterns, not synthetic examples.

---

## Using Events & Clusters

In the Laminar dashboard:

1. **Events** shows the raw event stream. Filter by time, event type, session, or user.
2. **Clusters** shows grouped patterns. Click any cluster to see its members and the auto-generated label.
3. **Export** cluster members to a dataset for evaluation.

You can also query event and cluster data in the [SQL editor](/analyze/sql)—find your largest clusters, newest clusters, or clusters matching specific criteria.

## How Clustering Works

Laminar uses embedding-based similarity. Events are converted to vectors, and similar events end up near each other in embedding space. The system continuously updates clusters as new events arrive.

Temporal proximity matters too—events close in time from the same user are more likely to be related than events hours apart.

Clusters have freshness scores. Active patterns stay prominent; stale clusters age out over time.

## Best Practices

**Let clusters emerge.** Don't over-specify upfront. Run your agent, observe what clusters form, then decide which patterns matter.

**Use clusters for evaluation.** When you find a problematic cluster, export it as a dataset. Run evaluations against it. Measure improvement over time.

**Monitor for new clusters.** New clusters appearing often means new failure modes. Existing clusters growing rapidly can signal a regression.
