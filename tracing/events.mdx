title: Sending custom events to Laminar
sidebarTitle: Custom events
---

Laminar allows you to send custom events to the platform. This can be useful for tracking any events that are not covered by the spans and tracing.

## Introduction

You can think of events as a data payload attached to a single timestamp.

Main difference between events and spans is that events have a single timestamp and don't have a duration.

Events allow you to track **any free-form data** that happens in your application

You can then run [queries](/sql-editor/introduction) on the events to get event-based analytics and insights. You can also build [custom dashboards](/custom-dashboards/overview) to visualize the events.

## Sending events

To send an event, simply use the `event` function on `Laminar` class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript">

```javascript
import { Laminar } from "@lmnr-ai/lmnr"

Laminar.initialize();

Laminar.event({
    name: "my-event",
    attributes: {
        "user-feedback": "positive",
        "user_data": JSON.stringify({
            "name": "John Doe",
            "age": 30,
            "email": "john.doe@example.com"
        })
    }
})
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">

```python
import json
from lmnr import Laminar

Laminar.initialize()

Laminar.event(
    name="my-event",
    attributes={
        "user-feedback": "positive",
        "user_data": json.dumps({
            "name": "John Doe",
            "age": 30,
            "email": "john.doe@example.com"
        })
    }
)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Span context

If you create an event inside a span context, e.g. in an `observe`d function, the event will be associated with the current span.

Otherwise, we will create a new span for the event and attach the event to it.

### Timestamp

By default, event will have the current timestamp.

You can also specify the timestamp manually:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript">

```javascript
import { Laminar } from "@lmnr-ai/lmnr"

Laminar.initialize();

Laminar.event({
    name: "my-event",
    timestamp: new Date("2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z")
})
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">

```python
from datetime import datetime
from lmnr import Laminar

Laminar.initialize()

Laminar.event(
    name="my-event",
    timestamp=datetime(2025, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)
)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Attributes

Attributes are passed as an object/dictionary. Allowed attribute types are `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `string[]`, `number[]`, `boolean[]`.

<Tip>

If you want to pass a JSON object as an attribute, you need to stringify it first.

</Tip>


## Specifying session or user id

You can associate an event with a session id or user id.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript">

```javascript
import { Laminar } from "@lmnr-ai/lmnr"

Laminar.initialize();

Laminar.event({
    name: "my-event",
    sessionId: "123",
    userId: "456"
})
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">

```python
from lmnr import Laminar

Laminar.initialize()

Laminar.event(
    name="my-event",
    session_id="123",
    user_id="456"
)
```

<Note>
Python SDK also supports inferring session and user id from the current trace.
</Note>

```python
from lmnr import Laminar, observe
Laminar.initialize()


def handler():
    # This event will be associated with session id "123", because
    # we set it in the main function
    Laminar.event(name="my-event")

@observe
def main():
    Laminar.set_session_id("123")
    handler()

main()
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Querying events

You can query events using the `events` table in Laminar [SQL Editor](/sql-editor/introduction).

```sql
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE session_id = '123'
AND timestamp >= '2025-01-01T00:00:00'
```
