# Semantic Events & Clusters

Laminar automatically identifies patterns in your traces by clustering similar events together. This helps you understand what your agents are actually doing at scale—without manually tagging everything.

## What Are Semantic Events?

A semantic event is a structured record of something that happened: an action, a state change, a decision. Laminar captures these automatically from your traces.

Each event includes:

- **What happened** — The event type (e.g., `extraction.completed`, `navigation.failed`)
- **Who/what triggered it** — User, session, or agent identifier
- **Context** — Where it happened (which workflow, which page, which model)
- **Payload** — The relevant data (input, output, parameters)
- **Timestamp** — When it occurred

Events are immutable and append-only. Once recorded, they don't change—you build understanding by analyzing patterns across events, not by modifying them.

## What Are Clusters?

Clusters group related events into coherent stories. Instead of looking at thousands of individual events, you see patterns:

- **Session clusters** — All events from a single user session, bounded by time
- **Intent clusters** — Events that share a common goal or topic, even across sessions
- **Anomaly clusters** — Outliers and unusual patterns grouped together
- **Similar failures** — Errors with the same root cause, regardless of surface differences

Each cluster has a centroid (the "center" of the group in embedding space), member events, confidence scores, and automatically generated labels.

## How Clustering Works

Laminar uses a hybrid approach:

**Embedding-based similarity** — Events are converted to vectors. Similar events end up near each other. Fast approximate nearest-neighbor search finds candidates.

**Rule-based refinement** — Deterministic rules handle precision-critical cases: same user + same query + short time gap = same session.

**Temporal analysis** — Time matters. Events close in time from the same user are more likely related than events hours apart.

The system continuously updates clusters as new events arrive. Clusters have freshness scores and TTLs—stale clusters age out, active patterns stay prominent.

## What You Can Do With This

**Understand user behavior** — See what users are actually trying to accomplish, not just what buttons they clicked. Intent clusters reveal the "why" behind actions.

**Debug at scale** — When something breaks, find all similar failures instantly. One fix addresses an entire cluster of issues.

**Detect anomalies** — Unusual patterns surface automatically. Spot problems before users report them.

**Track trends** — See how behavior changes over time. New clusters emerging? Old patterns disappearing?

**Build datasets** — Export clusters as evaluation datasets. Test your agent against real-world patterns, not synthetic examples.

## Viewing Clusters

In the Laminar dashboard:

1. Go to **Events** to see the raw event stream
2. Switch to **Clusters** to see grouped patterns
3. Click any cluster to see its members, centroid, labels, and confidence score
4. Filter by time range, event type, or cluster label
5. Export cluster members to a dataset for evaluation

## Example: Finding Extraction Failures

Your browser agent extracts product data. Some extractions fail. Instead of searching through logs:

1. Filter events to `extraction.failed`
2. View clusters—Laminar groups failures by similarity
3. One cluster shows 47 failures, all on sites with lazy-loaded content
4. Another cluster shows 12 failures, all with the same malformed selector
5. Fix each root cause once, verify with the cluster members

## Best Practices

**Let clusters emerge** — Don't over-specify upfront. Run your agent, observe what clusters form, then decide which patterns matter.

**Use clusters for evaluation** — When you find a problematic cluster, export it as a dataset. Run evaluations against it. Measure improvement.

**Monitor cluster health** — Watch for new clusters appearing (new failure modes?) or existing clusters growing rapidly (regression?).

**Combine with SQL** — Query cluster metadata in the SQL editor. Find your largest clusters, newest clusters, or clusters with specific labels.
