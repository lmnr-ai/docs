title: Semantic Events & Clusters
---

Laminar automatically identifies patterns in your traces by clustering similar events together. This helps you understand what your agents are actually doing at scale—without manually tagging everything.

## What Are Semantic Events?

A semantic event is structured data that Laminar extracts from your traces using an LLM. You define what to look for (for example, “did the user complete checkout?”), and Laminar interprets your trace data to produce a typed event with the fields you specify.

This is different from logging events in your code—you don't instrument anything. Laminar reads your existing traces and extracts meaning from them.

Each event includes:

- **What happened** — The event type (e.g., `extraction.completed`, `navigation.failed`)
- **Who/what triggered it** — User, session, or agent identifier
- **Context** — Where it happened (which workflow, which page, which model)
- **Payload** — The relevant data (input, output, parameters)
- **Timestamp** — When it occurred

Events are immutable and append-only. Once recorded, they don't change—you build understanding by analyzing patterns across events, not by modifying them.

## When to Use Semantic Events

Use semantic events when you want to track something that isn't explicitly logged but can be inferred from trace data:

- **Business outcomes** — Did the user complete their goal? Did the agent succeed? You might not log `checkout.completed` explicitly, but an LLM can infer it from the sequence of tool calls and responses.
- **Failure categorization** — Your traces show errors, but semantic events can classify why something failed (user error, rate limit, bad input, model confusion).
- **Behavioral patterns** — Detect when users abandon flows, retry actions, or hit edge cases—without adding logging to your code.

If you're already logging structured events in your application, you may not need semantic events for those. Use them for insights you can't easily instrument.

## Creating a semantic event (UI)

To define a new semantic event from trace data (no code changes required):

<Frame caption="Creating a new semantic event in the Laminar UI">
  <img src="/images/create-event.png" alt="Create new semantic event form showing name, prompt, structured output schema, and trigger spans" />
</Frame>

1. Open **Events** → **Event definitions**.
2. Select the **Semantic** tab and click **+ Event Definition**.
3. In the “Create new semantic event” panel:
   - (Optional) **Start from a template** to prefill the prompt, schema, and triggers.
   - **Name**: choose a stable event name (for example, `checkout.completed` or `navigation.failed`).
   - **Prompt**: describe what the event should detect/extract from the trace/span data.
   - **Structured Output**: define a JSON schema for the event payload (keep it small and stable).
   - **Trigger Spans**: click **Add Span** and enter the span name(s) that should trigger this event. Pick spans that contain the context you need (often an LLM span, a tool span, or your request/root span).
4. Click **Create**.

If you’re unsure what to put under **Trigger Spans**, open a representative trace and copy the relevant span’s **name** (avoid spans whose names contain dynamic IDs).

### Create clusters for an event definition

After your semantic event starts producing results, you can cluster it:

<Frame caption="Starting clustering for a semantic event definition">
  <img src="/images/start-clustering.png" alt="Start Clustering dialog with value template input" />
</Frame>

1. In **Events**, click your event definition to open it.
2. Click **Start Clustering**.
3. Choose a **Value Template** (Mustache-like) that represents what “similar” means for this event (for example, cluster by an error message, URL, tool name, or other payload field).
4. Click **Start**, then switch to **Clusters** to see grouped results.

## What Are Clusters?

Clusters group similar events together based on the value template you provide. When you start clustering, you choose what “similar” means—cluster by error message, by URL, by tool name, or by any field in your event payload.

Common patterns that emerge:

- **Similar failures** — Errors with the same root cause, regardless of surface differences (for example, 47 failures all caused by lazy-loaded content).
- **Behavioral groups** — Events that share a common action or intent (for example, all “search for product” events).
- **Anomalies** — Events that don't fit any cluster, surfaced as outliers worth investigating.

You control the clustering by choosing the value template. Laminar handles the similarity matching and keeps clusters updated as new events arrive.

Each cluster has a centroid (the "center" of the group in embedding space), member events, confidence scores, and automatically generated labels.

## How Clustering Works

When you start clustering, Laminar evaluates your **Value Template** (Mustache-like) for each semantic event and uses the resulting value as the primary grouping signal.

As new events arrive, clusters continuously update and stay current, so you can track emerging patterns and regressions over time.

## What You Can Do With This

**Understand user behavior** — See what users are actually trying to accomplish, not just what buttons they clicked. Intent clusters reveal the "why" behind actions.

**Debug at scale** — When something breaks, find all similar failures instantly. One fix addresses an entire cluster of issues.

**Detect anomalies** — Unusual patterns surface automatically. Spot problems before users report them.

**Track trends** — See how behavior changes over time. New clusters emerging? Old patterns disappearing?

**Build datasets** — Export clusters as evaluation datasets. Test your agent against real-world patterns, not synthetic examples.

## Viewing Clusters

In the Laminar dashboard:

1. Go to **Events** to see the raw event stream
2. Switch to **Clusters** to see grouped patterns
3. Click any cluster to see its members, centroid, labels, and confidence score
4. Filter by time range, event type, or cluster label
5. Export cluster members to a dataset for evaluation

## Example: Finding Extraction Failures

Your browser agent extracts product data. Some extractions fail. Instead of searching through logs:

1. Filter events to `extraction.failed`
2. View clusters—Laminar groups failures by similarity
3. One cluster shows 47 failures, all on sites with lazy-loaded content
4. Another cluster shows 12 failures, all with the same malformed selector
5. Fix each root cause once, verify with the cluster members

## Best Practices

**Let clusters emerge** — Don't over-specify upfront. Run your agent, observe what clusters form, then decide which patterns matter.

**Use clusters for evaluation** — When you find a problematic cluster, export it as a dataset. Run evaluations against it. Measure improvement.

**Monitor cluster health** — Watch for new clusters appearing (new failure modes?) or existing clusters growing rapidly (regression?).

**Combine with SQL** — Query cluster metadata in the SQL editor. Find your largest clusters, newest clusters, or clusters with specific labels.
