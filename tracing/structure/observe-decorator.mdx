# Observe Decorator/Wrapper

The `@observe` decorator (Python) or `observe()` wrapper (JavaScript) is the simplest way to trace a function. It automatically:

- Creates a span when the function is called
- Names the span after the function (or a custom name you provide)
- Captures input arguments and return values
- Ends the span when the function returns
- Records exceptions if the function throws

## When to Use Observe vs Manual Spans

| Use `@observe` when... | Use manual spans when... |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Tracing a function call | Tracing code that isn't a function |
| You want automatic input/output capture | You need conditional span creation |
| The function name works as the span name | You need runtime-determined names |
| Simple, straightforward tracing | Fine-grained control over timing |

## Nesting Behavior

Observed functions automatically nest. If function A calls function B, and both are observed, B's span becomes a child of A's span. This happens through context propagation—Laminar tracks the "current" span and parents new spans to it.

You can mix `@observe` with manual spans. A manual span created inside an observed function becomes a child of that function's span.
