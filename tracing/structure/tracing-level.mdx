title: Disable content tracing
description: Disable content tracing for a span
---

Sometimes, you may want to dynamically disable tracing for a particular span.
For example, some of your customers need more privacy than others, and you only
want to collect metadata for some of them.

To achieve this, we offer a wrapper that can set tracing to one of the following modes:
- `ALL` – trace everything as normal
- `META_ONLY` – do not trace inputs and outputs
- `OFF` – do not trace anything within the wrapper
