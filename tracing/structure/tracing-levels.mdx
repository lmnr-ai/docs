title: Tracing Levels
description: Control what data is captured for privacy and compliance.
---

Sometimes you need trace structure without content—for sensitive operations, compliance requirements, or customer-specific privacy settings.

## Levels

| Level | What's Captured |
|-------|-----------------|
| **ALL** | Everything—inputs, outputs, attributes (default) |
| **META_ONLY** | Structure and timing, but no inputs or outputs |
| **OFF** | Nothing within the scope |

### When to Use META_ONLY

- **PII handling** — Trace that a function ran without capturing personal data
- **Compliance** — Meet data residency or retention requirements
- **Customer preference** — Some customers may require limited data collection

You can set tracing level globally, per-trace, or for a specific block of code. This lets you handle mixed requirements—full tracing for most operations, META_ONLY for sensitive ones.
