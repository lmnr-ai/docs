# Tracing Structure Overview

Tracing captures work as spans organized into traces. This section shows how to structure spans, choose between decorators and manual spans, and add the right context for debugging and analytics.

- Use `@observe` / `observe()` for the simplest function-level tracing.
- Use manual spans when you need conditional tracing, dynamic names, or to trace non-function code.
- Add context early: user/session IDs, metadata, and tags make traces filterable and useful.
- Control privacy with tracing levels, and flush spans before process exit in serverless/CLI flows.
