You've initialized Laminar. Your LLM calls are traced automatically. Now what?

This section covers what to do when auto-instrumentation isn't enough:

- **Trace your own functions** — Your agent has logic beyond LLM calls. Wrap functions with `@observe` to see them in traces.
- **Add context** — Attach user IDs, session IDs, metadata, and tags so you can filter and debug effectively.
- **Control what's captured** — Use tracing levels to redact sensitive data, or skip tracing entirely for certain operations.

If you just want to trace LLM calls and framework operations, you don't need this section—[Integrations](/integrations) has you covered. Come back here when you want deeper visibility into your own code.

## Quick Reference

| I want to... | Use |
|--------------|-----|
| Trace a function I wrote | [`@observe` decorator](/tracing/observe) |
| Trace code that isn't a function | [Manual spans](/tracing/manual-spans) |
| Link traces to users or conversations | [Sessions & User IDs](/tracing/sessions) |
| Add filterable context to traces | [Metadata & Tags](/tracing/metadata) |
| Redact inputs/outputs for privacy | [Tracing Levels](/tracing/privacy) |
| Ensure spans send in serverless/CLI | [Flushing & Lifecycle](/sdk/lifecycle) |
