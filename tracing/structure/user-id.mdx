# User ID

Link traces to your users to make debugging and analytics easier.

- Set a user ID at the trace level so every span in the trace carries it.
- Use it to filter traces by user in the Laminar UI and analyze patterns across user segments.

Assign the user ID at the entry point of your application (API handler, consumer, job) so all child spans inherit it.
