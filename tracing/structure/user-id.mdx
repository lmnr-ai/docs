## Associating Traces with Users

Tracking which user triggered a particular trace is crucial for:
- User-specific debugging
- Analyzing usage patterns
- Filtering traces in the dashboard
- Compliance with data regulations

In Laminar, you can associate traces with users by setting user ID on a trace.

## Setting User ID

This allows you to filter and search for traces by user ID later.

```javascript
import { Laminar, observe } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';

// Option 1. directly pass userId to observe
await observe({
    name: 'processUserRequest',
    userId: 'user_123'
}, async () => {
    // Process user request here
});

// Option 2.Use Laminar.setTraceUserId
await observe({
    name: 'processUserRequest',
}, async () => {
    Laminar.setTraceUserId('user_123');
    // Process user request here
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">

```python
from lmnr import Laminar, observe

# Option 1: Directly in the observe decorator
# Note that this is static, i.e. you can't change this at runtime.
@observe(user_id='user_123')
def process_user_request():
    # Process user request here
    pass

# Option 2: Use Laminar.set_trace_user_id
@observe()
def process_user_request(req):
    # IMPORTANT: set_trace_user_id must be called within an active span context
    # Here, the @observe decorator creates that context
    Laminar.set_trace_user_id('user_123')
    # Process user request here
```

Another approach using `start_as_current_span`:

```python
from lmnr import Laminar

def process_user_request(user_id):
    with Laminar.start_as_current_span(name="process_request") as span:
        # Now we have an active span context
        Laminar.set_trace_user_id('user_123')
        # Your code here
```

❌ **Incorrect usage** (will not work):

```python
# This won't work because it's outside any span context
Laminar.set_trace_user_id('user_123')

@observe()
def my_function():
    # The metadata set above won't be applied here
    pass
```

✅ **Correct usage**:

```python
@observe()
def my_function():
    # Set metadata inside the span context
    Laminar.set_trace_user_id('user_123')
    # Your code here
```

## Privacy Considerations

When including user IDs in traces, consider the following privacy practices:

- Use anonymous or pseudonymous IDs rather than personally identifiable information
- Consider your data retention policies
- Use Laminar's [tracing level](/tracing/structure/tracing-level) settings to control sensitive data
- Follow relevant data protection regulations

// Use TracingLevel.META_ONLY for sensitive user operations
import { withTracingLevel, TracingLevel } from "@lmnr-ai/lmnr";

withTracingLevel(TracingLevel.META_ONLY, () => {
    // Sensitive operations here will only record metadata
    // Input/output content won't be saved
});
