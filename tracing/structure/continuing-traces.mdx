title: Continuing Traces
description: Propagate span context across services to keep traces connected.
---

When a request spans multiple services, you want one connected trace—not isolated fragments. This requires passing span context between services.

## Context Propagation

Span context is a serialized representation of the current span. Pass it to downstream services, and they can continue the same trace.

Common patterns:

- **HTTP headers** — Include serialized context in a custom header (e.g., `X-Laminar-Span-Context`)
- **Message queues** — Embed context in the message payload alongside your data
- **Database storage** — Store context with workflow state for long-running processes that span multiple requests

The downstream service deserializes the context and uses it as the parent for its spans. The result: a single trace showing the full request flow across services.

### When Context Is Unavailable

If deserialization fails or context is missing, start a new trace rather than crashing. The downstream work won't connect to the original trace, but you'll still have visibility into that service.
