# Metadata

Trace metadata applies to the entire trace. Use it for information that's constant across spans:

- **Environment** — production, staging, development
- **Region** — us-west, eu-central
- **Deployment** — version numbers, feature flags, A/B test variants
- **Request context** — correlation IDs, upstream service info

Set metadata early—ideally where the trace begins—so all spans share the same context.
