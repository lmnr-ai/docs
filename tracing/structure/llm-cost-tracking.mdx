title: LLM Cost Tracking
description: Create custom LLM spans and set required attributes for cost calculations.
---

Auto-instrumentation covers OpenAI, Anthropic, and other major providers. For unsupported providers or custom implementations, create LLM spans manually.

## When You Need This

- Self-hosted or fine-tuned models
- Providers Laminar doesn't instrument yet
- Direct HTTP calls to LLM APIs
- Custom inference servers

## Required Attributes

For Laminar to calculate costs and display LLM-specific UI, set these attributes:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Provider | Provider name (e.g., `openai`, `anthropic`, `custom`) |
| Request model | Model name you requested |
| Response model | Model name returned by the API |
| Input token count | Number of input tokens |
| Output token count | Number of output tokens |

Set `spanType: 'LLM'` when creating the span. Without this, the span appears as a generic operation.
