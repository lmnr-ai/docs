description: Categorize traces with tags for filtering and analysis.

# Tags

Tags categorize traces for filtering and analysis:

- Filter traces in the UI (e.g., "show all traces tagged `beta-feature`")
- Group traces for aggregate analysis
- Mark traces for review (e.g., `needs-review`, `regression`)

Use simple, consistent tag strings for categories you'll filter on later.
