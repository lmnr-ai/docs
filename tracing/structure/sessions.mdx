# Sessions

Sessions group related traces—useful for conversational AI, multi-step workflows, or tracking a user's journey through your product.

- Set a session ID at the trace level so all spans share it.
- In the Laminar UI, you can filter traces by session and review activity across a conversation or workflow.

Set session IDs early in the request/handler entry point so downstream spans inherit the context.
