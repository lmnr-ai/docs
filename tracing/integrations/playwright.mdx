[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is a framework for browser automation. It has bindings for both JavaScript and Python.

<Note>
  Laminar excels at tracing browser agents by providing unified visibility into both browser session recordings and agent execution steps.

## Playwright integration

Laminar has a native integration with Playwright for both JavaScript and Python. You simply need to initialize Laminar with your project API key and Playwright will be traced automatically.
We will hook into the API to create OpenTelemetry spans, but more importantly, we record browser session recordings.

<Tab title="JavaScript/Typescript">
```javascript {1, 4-11}
import { Laminar } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

Laminar.initialize({
  projectApiKey: process.env.LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY,
  instrumentModules: {
    playwright: {
      chromium
    }
  }
});

// The rest of your playwright code
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Python">
```python
from lmnr import Laminar
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

Laminar.initialize(project_api_key=os.environ["LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY"])

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch()
    # The rest of your playwright code
```

<Tip>
We recommend that you wrap your playwright code in a function call and `@observe` that function,
so that the session and the trace are properly linked.
