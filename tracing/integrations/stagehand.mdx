## Overview

[Stagehand](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand) is a relatively low-level AI-native framework for building browser agents in JavaScript.

Stagehand is designed to be a seamless extension of Playwright, and in particular, its Page API.

Thanks to Laminar's native integration with Playwright, you can trace your Stagehand agents with ease.

## Usage

<Steps>
<Step title="Initialize Laminar">

First, we need to initialize Laminar and pass all the LLM modules that you use in your Stagehand agents.

<Tip>
Import the LLM provider SDK and pass it to `instrumentModules`, depending
on the model that you use with Stagehand.
</Tip>

For example, if you use OpenAI with Stagehand, you can do the following:

```javascript {2-3, 5-11}
import { Stagehand } from '@browserbase/stagehand';
import { Laminar } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';

Laminar.initialize({
  projectApiKey: process.env.LMNR_API_KEY,
  instrumentModules: {
    stagehand: Stagehand,
    OpenAI: OpenAI,
  },
});
```

</Step>
<Step title="Using Stagehand">

You can now use the Stagehand API as usual.

```javascript
await stagehand.init({
  modelName: 'gpt-4.1-mini',
  modelClientOptions: {
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  },
});
const page = stagehand.page;
await page.act("...");
```
</Step>
<Step title="Finalizing Stagehand traces">

In order to finalize Stagehand traces, make sure to call `stagehand.close()` and `Laminar.flush()`,
especially if you are using Laminar and Stagehand in standalone scripts or edge runtimes.

```javascript
await stagehand.close(); // closes the browser and the parent span
await Laminar.flush(); // sends any remaining spans to Laminar
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### I can't see LLM calls, token counts, and costs in my trace

It is likely that you've started off with `npx create-browser-app`, which
creates the package as an ESM module.

#### Solution

Remove the `"type": "module"` from your `package.json` file.

<Tip>
You can also explicitly set the type to `commonjs` in your `package.json` file.

```json package.json
"type": "commonjs"
```
