description: Instrument your LangChain and LangGraph applications with Laminar
---

## Overview

Laminar automatically instruments [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) operations by simply initializing Laminar at the beginning of your Python application. This allows you to trace and monitor your LLM chains, agents, and graph-based workflows, providing complete visibility into your AI application's performance, costs, and behavior without needing to modify your existing LangChain/LangGraph code.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Laminar and LangChain/LangGraph

You'll need Laminar, LangChain core, any specific LangChain LLM/tool integrations (e.g., for OpenAI), and LangGraph:

```bash
pip install 'lmnr[all]' langchain langchain-openai langgraph python-dotenv
# Add other packages like langchain-community for specific tools if needed
```

### 2. Set up environment variables & Initialize Laminar

Store your API keys in a `.env` file and initialize Laminar once at the start of your application, before any LangChain or LangGraph code is executed.

```python {1,16}
from lmnr import Laminar
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, Sequence
import operator

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Initialize Laminar - this single step enables automatic tracing
Laminar.initialize()
```

<Note>
To see an example of how to integrate Laminar within a FastAPI application, check out our [FastAPI integration guide](/guides/fastapi).

### 3. Use LangChain and LangGraph as usual

**LangChain Example (Simple LLMChain):**

```python
# Ensure Laminar.initialize() was called as shown in Step 2.

model = ChatOpenAI()
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a helpful assistant."),
    ("human", "{question}")
])
output_parser = StrOutputParser()

chain = prompt | model | output_parser

# response = chain.invoke({"question": "What is the capital of France?"})
# print(response)
```

**LangGraph Example (Simple Graph):**

```python
# Ensure Laminar.initialize() was called as shown in Step 2.

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[Sequence[HumanMessage], operator.add]

llm = ChatOpenAI()

def call_model(state: AgentState):
    messages = state['messages']
    response = llm.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": [response]} # Append new message

# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.set_entry_point("agent")
workflow.add_edge("agent", END)

app = workflow.compile()

# inputs = {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Hi there!")]}
# result = app.invoke(inputs)
# print(result['messages'][-1].content)
```

All instrumentable LangChain and LangGraph operations are now automatically traced in Laminar.

## Monitoring Your LangChain Usage

After instrumenting your LangChain and LangGraph applications with Laminar, you'll be able to:

1.  **View detailed traces** of each chain, agent step, tool usage, and LLM call.
2.  **Track token usage and cost** across different models used within LangChain.
3.  **Monitor latency** and performance metrics for individual components and overall workflows.
4.  **Analyze prompt engineering** by inspecting inputs/outputs at each step.
5.  **Debug issues** with complex chains or graphs by visualizing their execution flow.

Visit your Laminar dashboard to view your LangChain traces and analytics.

## Advanced Features

Leverage Laminar's advanced features to get more out of your LangChain instrumentation:

- [Sessions](/tracing/manual-instrumentation#sessions) - Group related LangChain executions (e.g., a user conversation).
- [Metadata](/tracing/metadata) - Add custom context (e.g., user IDs, environment details) to your LangChain traces.
- [Trace structure](/tracing/structure) - Create custom spans to instrument parts of your application logic outside of LangChain.
- [Realtime Monitoring](/tracing/realtime) - Observe your LangChain applications in real-time.
