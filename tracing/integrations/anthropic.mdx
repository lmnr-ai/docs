## Overview

Laminar automatically instruments the official Anthropic package with a single line of code, allowing you to trace and monitor all your Anthropic API calls without modifying your existing code. This provides complete visibility into your AI application's performance, costs, and behavior.

## Getting Started

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ### 1. Install Laminar and Anthropic

    ```bash
    npm install @lmnr-ai/lmnr @anthropic-ai/sdk
    ```

    ### 2. Set up your environment variables

    Store your API keys in a `.env` file:

    ```bash
    # .env file
    LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY=your-laminar-project-api-key
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
    ```

    Then load them in your application using a package like [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

    <Note>
    If you are using Anthropic with Next.js, please follow the [Next.js integration guide](/tracing/integrations/nextjs) for best practices and setup instructions.
    </Note>

    ### 3. Initialize Laminar

    Just add a single line at the start of your application or file to instrument Anthropic with Laminar.

    ```typescript
    import { Laminar } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';
    import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';
    import 'dotenv/config'; // Load environment variables

    // This single line instruments all Anthropic API calls
    Laminar.initialize({
      instrumentModules: { anthropic: Anthropic }
    });

    // Initialize Anthropic client as usual
    const anthropic = new Anthropic();
    ```
    <Note>
    It is important to pass `Anthropic` to `instrumentModules` as a named export.
    </Note>

    ### 4. Use Anthropic as usual

    ```typescript
    // Make API calls to Anthropic as you normally would
    const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
      model: "claude-3-7-sonnet",
      max_tokens: 1024,
      messages: [
        { role: "user", content: "Hello, how are you?" }
      ],
    });

    console.log(response.content);
    ```

    All Anthropic API calls are now automatically traced in Laminar.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ### 1. Install Laminar and Anthropic

    ```bash
    pip install 'lmnr[all]' anthropic python-dotenv
    ```

    ### 2. Set up your environment variables

    Store your API keys in a `.env` file:

    ```bash
    # .env file
    LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY=your-laminar-project-api-key
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
    ```

    <Note>

    </Note>

    ### 3. Initialize Laminar

    Just add a single line at the start of your application or file to instrument Anthropic with Laminar.

    ```python
    from lmnr import Laminar
    from anthropic import Anthropic
    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    # Load environment variables from .env file
    load_dotenv()

    # This single line instruments all Anthropic API calls
    Laminar.initialize()

    # Initialize Anthropic client as usual
    client = Anthropic()
    ```

    ### 4. Use Anthropic as usual

    ```python
    # Make API calls to Anthropic as you normally would
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-7-sonnet",
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
        ]
    )

    print(response.content)
    ```

    All Anthropic API calls are now automatically traced in Laminar.

These features allow you to build more structured traces, add context to your LLM calls, and gain deeper insights into your AI application's performance.

## Monitoring Your Anthropic Usage

After instrumenting your Anthropic calls with Laminar, you'll be able to:

1. **View detailed traces** of each Anthropic API call, including request and response
2. **Track token usage and cost** across different models
3. **Monitor latency** and performance metrics
4. **Open LLM span in Playground** for prompt engineering
5. **Debug issues** with failed API calls or unexpected model outputs

Visit your Laminar dashboard to view your Anthropic traces and analytics.

## Advanced Features

- Enrich traces with sessions, user IDs, metadata, and tags via the [SDK reference](/sdk/reference).
- Wrap custom functions with `observe` to capture business logic alongside model calls (see the SDK reference).
