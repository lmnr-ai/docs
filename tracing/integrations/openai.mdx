## Overview

Laminar automatically instruments the official OpenAI package with a single line of code, allowing you to trace and monitor all your OpenAI API calls without modifying your existing code. This provides complete visibility into your AI application's performance, costs, and behavior.

## Getting Started

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ### 1. Install Laminar and OpenAI

    ```bash
    npm install @lmnr-ai/lmnr openai
    ```

    ### 2. Set up your environment variables

    Store your API keys in a `.env` file:

    ```bash
    # .env file
    LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY=your-laminar-project-api-key
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
    ```

    Then load them in your application using a package like [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

    <Note>
    If you are using OpenAI with Next.js, please follow the [Next.js integration guide](/tracing/integrations/nextjs) for best practices and setup instructions.
    </Note>

    ### 3. Initialize Laminar

    Just add a single line at the start of your application or file to instrument OpenAI with Laminar.

    ```typescript
    import { Laminar } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';
    import OpenAI from 'openai';
    import 'dotenv/config'; // Load environment variables

    // This single line instruments all OpenAI API calls
    Laminar.initialize({
      instrumentModules: { OpenAI: OpenAI }
    });

    // Initialize OpenAI client as usual
    const openai = new OpenAI();
    ```
    <Note>
    It is important to pass `OpenAI` to `instrumentModules` as a named export.
    </Note>

    ### 4. Use OpenAI as usual

    ```typescript
    // Make API calls to OpenAI as you normally would
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
        { role: "user", content: "Hello, how are you?" }
      ],
    });

    console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
    ```

    All OpenAI API calls are now automatically traced in Laminar.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ### 1. Install Laminar and OpenAI

    ```bash
    pip install 'lmnr[all]' openai python-dotenv
    ```

    ### 2. Set up your environment variables

    Store your API keys in a `.env` file:

    ```bash
    # .env file
    LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY=your-laminar-project-api-key
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
    ```

    <Note>
    To see an example of how to integrate Laminar within a FastAPI application, check out our [FastAPI integration guide](/guides/fastapi).
    </Note>

    ### 3. Initialize Laminar

    Just add a single line at the start of your application or file to instrument OpenAI with Laminar.

    ```python
    from lmnr import Laminar
    from openai import OpenAI
    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    # Load environment variables from .env file
    load_dotenv()

    # This single line instruments all OpenAI API calls
    Laminar.initialize()

    # Initialize OpenAI client as usual
    client = OpenAI()
    ```

    ### 4. Use OpenAI as usual

    ```python
    # Make API calls to OpenAI as you normally would
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4.1-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
        ]
    )

    print(response.choices[0].message.content)
    ```

    All OpenAI API calls are now automatically traced in Laminar.

These features allow you to build more structured traces, add context to your LLM calls, and gain deeper insights into your AI application's performance.

## Monitoring Your OpenAI Usage

After instrumenting your OpenAI calls with Laminar, you'll be able to:

1. **View detailed traces** of each OpenAI API call, including request and response
2. **Track token usage and cost** across different models
3. **Monitor latency** and performance metrics
4. **Open LLM span in Playground** for prompt engineering
5. **Debug issues** with failed API calls or unexpected model outputs

Visit your Laminar dashboard to view your OpenAI traces and analytics.

## Advanced Features

- Enrich traces with sessions, user IDs, metadata, and tags via the SDK reference.
- Wrap custom functions with `observe` to capture business logic alongside model calls.
- Images sent to vision-capable models are captured automatically — see [Tracing Images](/tracing/structure/images).

## Vision inputs (images)

Laminar automatically traces image inputs (data URLs and external URLs) sent to vision-capable OpenAI models.
