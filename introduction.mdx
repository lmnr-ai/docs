description: Observability and evaluations for agents.
---

Laminar gives you visibility into your agents—every LLM call, tool use, and decision—and the tools to systematically improve them.

The docs follow the iteration cycle that our users go through:

1. **Build & Experiment** — trace locally, test in playgrounds
2. **Ship to Production** — instrument your stack
3. **Observe** — traces, sessions, costs, dashboards
4. **Analyze & Debug** — SQL queries, events, online evaluators
5. **Improve with Evaluations** — datasets, labeling, structured eval runs

Start with the [Quickstart](/quickstart) or jump to the section that matches where you are.

<Note>New to Laminar? A **trace** is a full execution flow and a **span** is a single operation inside it. See [Traces & Spans](/observe-in-production/traces-and-spans) for the core model.</Note>
