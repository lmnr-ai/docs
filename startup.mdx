# Installation

Get started with Laminar in minutes. Choose between our hosted platform or self-host the entire stack locally.

## Hosted (Recommended)

Sign up at [laminar.ai](https://laminar.ai), create a project, and grab your API key from project settings.

Install the SDK:

```bash
npm add @lmnr-ai/lmnr
```

```bash
pip install lmnr
```

Initialize:

```javascript
import { Laminar } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';

Laminar.initialize({
    projectApiKey: "<YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY>",
    instrumentModules: {
        // your libraries to instrument
    }
})
```

```python
from lmnr import Laminar

Laminar.initialize(project_api_key="<YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY>")
```

That's it. Your traces will appear in the dashboard.

## Self-Hosted

Run the full Laminar stack locally with Docker Compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr
cd lmnr
docker compose up -d
```

The dashboard is now available at `http://localhost:5667/`. Create a project through the onboarding flow (any valid email works by default), then grab your API key from project settings.

Point the SDK to your local instance:

```javascript
import { Laminar } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';

Laminar.initialize({
    projectApiKey: "<YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY>",
    baseUrl: "http://localhost",
    httpPort: 8000,
    grpcPort: 8001,
    instrumentModules: {
        // your libraries to instrument
    }
})
```

```python
from lmnr import Laminar

Laminar.initialize(
    project_api_key="<YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY>",
    base_url="http://localhost",
    http_port=8000,
    grpc_port=8001
)
```

For production self-hosting options, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr).

### Access Control

By default, any user can access your self-hosted instance. To restrict access to specific GitHub users, enable GitHub OAuth:

```bash
AUTH_GITHUB_ID=your_github_oauth_app_id
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_oauth_app_secret
```

Then create an `allowed-emails.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "emails": [
    "user1@example.com",
    "user2@example.com"
  ]
}
```

## Cursor Rules

Add Laminar-specific rules to Cursor for better AI-assisted development:

```bash
pip install 'lmnr[all]'
lmnr add-cursor-rules
```

This creates `.cursor/rules/laminar.mdc` with patterns for instrumentation, tracing, and evaluation. Reload your Cursor window (`Cmd+Shift+P` → "Reload Window") to activate.

You can also [download the rules file directly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr/main/.cursor/rules/laminar.mdc) and place it in `.cursor/rules/`.
