## Overview

Laminar supports optional GitHub authentication for controlling access to your self-hosted instance.

## GitHub Authentication Setup

To enable GitHub authentication, configure these environment variables in your frontend:

```
AUTH_GITHUB_ID=your_github_oauth_app_id
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_oauth_app_secret
```

## Access Control

### Default Behavior

By default (without an `allowed-emails.json` file), any GitHub user can access your platform after authentication.

### Restricted Access

To limit access to specific users, create an `allowed-emails.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "emails ": [
    "user1@example.com",
    "user2@example.com"
  ]
}
```
