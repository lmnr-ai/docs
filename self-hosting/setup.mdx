<Step title="[Optional] Learn more about self-hosting options">
There is more information about the set up and self-hosting options
including the contributing guide in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr).
</Step>
<Step title="Access the dashboard">
The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:5667/`.
</Step>
<Step title="Create a project and get the API key">
In the dashboard, go over the onboarding flow. By default, any email is accepted,
so just enter a valid email address and follow the instructions.

If you want to manage users/authentication, read the [access control](./access-control-setup) page.

Once you have your first workspace and the project, go to the project settings,
create a new API key and copy the value. You will not be able to see the key again.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure the SDK to export traces to the local instance">

By default, the backend will listen on port 8000 for HTTP and 8001 for gRPC.
