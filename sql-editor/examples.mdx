This page contains a collection of examples of SQL queries you can write with the Laminar SQL Editor.
For the reference of the table schemas and Laminar-specific syntax, see the [reference](/sql-editor/reference) page.

## Basic queries

### Counting spans in the last 3 days

```sql
SELECT
    count(span_id) as span_count
FROM spans
WHERE start_time BETWEEN now() - INTERVAL '3 days' AND now()
```

### Counting spans by name

```sql
SELECT
    name,
    count(span_id) as span_count
FROM spans
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY span_count DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Viewing spans of a specific evaluation run

```sql
SELECT
    name,
    input,
    output
FROM
    spans
WHERE
    -- this applies the necessary joins behind the scenes
    evaluation_name = 'the-evaluation-name'
```

This query will return the input and output of the spans of the evaluation run with the name `the-evaluation-name`.

It is useful to filter by span type in this query to filter either the executor (forward pass) or the evaluator spans.

### Filtering spans by type

```sql
SELECT
    name,
    input,
    output
FROM
    spans
WHERE
    span_type = 'LLM'
```

Available span types:

- `DEFAULT` - most of the spans fall into this category
- `LLM` - a manual or automatically traced LLM call
- `EVALUATION` - a span that represents an evaluation run. One datapoint is evaluated by one evaluation run.
- `EXECUTOR` - a span that represents an executor run. One datapoint is evaluated by one executor run.
- `EVALUATOR` - a span that represents an evaluator run. One datapoint may have multiple evaluator spans.
- `TOOL` - a span that represents a tool call.

### Filtering spans by span path

[Span path](/tracing/introduction#span) is the hierarchical path of the span.

For example, if your code looks like this:

```python [expandable]
@observe
def outer():
    @observe
    def inner():
        return "Hello, world!"
    return inner()
```

Then the span path of the `inner` function will be `["outer", "inner"]`.

Span path is stored as a JSONB array inside the `attributes` column's values.

However, Laminar SQL provides syntactic sugar for you to query, filter, order, or group by span path
items joined by a dot.

```sql
SELECT
    name,
    input,
    output
FROM spans WHERE path = 'outer.inner'
```

### Tags

Tags are returned as an SQL `text[]` array. Tags are stored outside of the `spans` table,
but Laminar SQL Editor joins them to the `spans` table by `span_id` and aggregates them
as an array.

SQL array syntax is not exactly trivial, so here are a few examples:

#### Filtering by a presence of a tag

```sql
SELECT 
    name,
    input,
    output,
    tags
FROM spans
-- this applies the necessary joins behind the scenes
WHERE 'my_tag' = ANY(tags)
```

#### Filtering by multiple tags

```sql
SELECT
    name,
    input,
    output,
    tags
FROM spans
-- the `@>` operator is the SQL array containment operator
WHERE tags @> ARRAY['tag1', 'tag2']
-- this is equivalent to
-- WHERE 'tag1' = ANY(tags) AND 'tag2' = ANY(tags)
-- and equivalent to
-- WHERE tags @> '{tag1, tag2}'::text[]
```

#### Filtering by any of the tags

```sql
SELECT
    name,
    input,
    output,
    tags
FROM spans
WHERE tags && ARRAY['tag1', 'tag2']
-- this is equivalent to
-- WHERE 'tag1' = ANY(tags) OR 'tag2' = ANY(tags)
```

#### Filtering based on the number of tags

This query will return all spans with more than 2 tags.

```sql
SELECT
    name,
    input,
    output,
    tags
FROM spans
-- second argument of `array_length` is the dimension of the array
-- in this case, it is 1 because `tags` is a 1-dimensional array
WHERE array_length(tags, 1) > 2
```

### Filtering spans by evaluator scores

```sql
SELECT
    name,
    input,
    output,
    evaluator_scores.my_score
FROM spans
-- this applies the necessary joins behind the scenes
WHERE evaluator_scores.my_score > 0.5
```

### Filtering evaluation results by scores

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    index,
    duration,
    evaluation_scores."My Score"
FROM evaluation_results
WHERE evaluation_scores."My Score" >= 0
```

## Advanced examples

### Digging into the LLM span attributes and type casting

```sql
SELECT 
    name,
    input,
    output,
    attributes->>'gen_ai.response.model' response_model,
    (attributes->>'gen_ai.usage.input_tokens')::int8 input_tokens,
    (attributes->>'gen_ai.usage.output_tokens')::int8 output_tokens,
    (attributes->>'gen_ai.usage.input_cost')::float8 input_cost,
    (attributes->>'gen_ai.usage.output_cost')::float8 output_cost
FROM spans
WHERE span_type = 'LLM'
```
