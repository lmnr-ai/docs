Query your Laminar data with ClickHouse SQL to drive dashboards, exports, and debugging. Use these patterns to keep queries fast and reliable.

## What you'll do

- Write SELECT-only queries against spans, traces, events, and eval tables.  
- Filter efficiently (start_time) and avoid heavy joins.  
- Extract JSON fields and truncate time for grouping.

## Fast patterns

- Always filter by `start_time` when possible for performance.  
- Prefer application-side joins; fetch ids in one query, hydrate in another.  
- Use `simpleJSONExtract*` when you know the type.

### Example: spans per day (last month)

```sql
SELECT
  toStartOfInterval(start_time, INTERVAL 1 DAY) AS day,
  count(*) AS spans_count
FROM spans
WHERE start_time > now() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day
```

### Example: extract JSON

```sql
SELECT
  simpleJSONExtractInt(attributes, 'gen_ai.usage.input_tokens') AS input_tokens
FROM spans
WHERE span_type = 'LLM'
  AND start_time > now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY
```

## Why this matters

- Faster queries keep the UI responsive and avoid timeouts.  
- Targeted filters and JSON extraction make it easy to find outliers and costs.  
- Clean patterns mean less time troubleshooting queries and more time improving agents.
