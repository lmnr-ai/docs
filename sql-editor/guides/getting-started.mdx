## Prerequisites

- You must have some data stored at Laminar, such as traces or evaluation results.

## Scope

Laminar SQL queries are limited to the data within your project. To query data from other projects, switch the project in the UI, or change the API key that you use to access the API.

## Clickhouse syntax

Clickhouse flavor of SQL is an extension of standard SQL, so most of the basic SQL queries are supported.

## First query

```sql
SELECT
    input,
    output,
    start_time
FROM spans
WHERE start_time BETWEEN now() - INTERVAL '3 days' AND now()
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 100
```

This query will return the input and output of the spans in the last 3 days.

We use `now()` to get the current time and LIMIT to just a 100 spans, because input and output are large fields.

### Filtering by span type

Often you want to only query stats on LLM spans. You can do this by filtering by the `span_type` column.

```sql
SELECT
    AVG(end_time - start_time) AS avg_duration
FROM spans
WHERE span_type = 1 -- 1 for LLM, 0 for DEFAULT
AND start_time > now() - INTERVAL '1 month'
```

## Best practices

### Filtering by start time

You almost certainly want to add a `start_time` filter to your `spans` or `traces` query even if you filter by other columns, e.g. `trace_id`.
This will speed up the query and prevent it from failing because of running out of memory.

### Avoid using JOINs

Clickhouse is an OLAP database, so it's not optimized for joins. If you need to join data, you can do it in the application layer.
