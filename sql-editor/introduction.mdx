Laminar SQL Editor is a tool that allows you to write and execute SQL queries on your data stored at Laminar.

This allows you to:
- Perform advanced analytics on your data
- Export any trace or evaluation result to a dataset
- Run queries on your data in the API and collect results in your preferred format

<Tip>
    The SQL Editor is currently in beta.
    Some functionality may change.
    We value your feedback and suggestions.
    Please [contact us](mailto:founders@laminar.ai) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/nNFUUDAKub) to share your thoughts.
</Tip>

Laminar SQL editor queries data stored in [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/).
Queries must be written in [ClickHouse SQL](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference).

For detailed reference of the syntax, see the [reference](/sql-editor/reference) page.

<Tip>
    You can only access data from the current project in the SQL Editor.

## Features and benefits

- Write and execute SQL queries on your data stored at Laminar
- Filtering:
    - By date range
    - By span name and path
    - By span tags
    - By trace costs, duration, etc.
- Fast analytics on your data, e.g.
    - Detailed breakdown of token count and cost by operation
    - Detailed latency analysis
    - Dashboarding
- Exporting results to Laminar datasets or labelling queues

## Allowed queries and limitations

- Only `SELECT` queries are allowed.
- Allowed tables (to select from):
    - `spans`
    - `traces`
    - `events`
    - `evaluation_scores`
    - `evaluation_datapoints`

For detailed information about the tables and columns, see the [reference](/sql-editor/reference) page.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- You must have some data stored at Laminar, such as traces or evaluation results.

### Using the SQL Editor

SQL Editor is available in the sidebar.

### Using SQL Query API

You can also run queries directly from the API. It is available at the `/v1/sql/query` endpoint.

Read the [API reference](/api-reference/sql/sql_query) page for more information.

### Example query

```sql
SELECT
    input,
    output,
    start_time
FROM spans
WHERE start_time BETWEEN now() - INTERVAL '3 days' AND now()
```

This query will return the input and output of the spans in the last 3 days.

### Viewing results

Results are displayed in a table or raw JSON view.

### Exporting results

Once you have selected the results you want to export, click the "Export to Dataset" button.

Choose the dataset you want to export to and map the columns to the dataset `data`, `metadata`, and `target` fields.
