sidebarTitle: Introduction

Use the SQL editor to slice traces, spans, events, and eval results with ClickHouse SQL, then turn queries into dashboards or datasets.

## What you'll do in minutes

- Run ClickHouse SQL over Laminar data (`spans`, `traces`, `events`, `evaluation_scores`, `evaluation_datapoints`).  
- Visualize results or export them to datasets/queues.  
- Build dashboards from saved queries.

<Tip>
SQL editor is in beta. Share feedback at founders@laminar.ai or on Discord.

## Fast start

1. Open **SQL Editor** in the sidebar.  
2. Paste a query and run it (SELECT-only).  
3. View results as table or JSON.  
4. Export to a dataset or add to a dashboard.

Example query (last 3 days of LLM spans):

```sql
SELECT
  name,
  model,
  total_tokens,
  cost,
  start_time
FROM spans
WHERE span_type = 'LLM'
  AND start_time >= now() - INTERVAL 3 DAY
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 200
```

## Common recipes

- **Cost by model**: `SELECT model, sum(cost) FROM spans WHERE span_type='LLM' GROUP BY model ORDER BY 2 DESC`  
- **Slow routes**: `SELECT route, p95(duration_ms) AS p95_ms FROM traces GROUP BY route ORDER BY p95_ms DESC`  
- **Eval score drift**: `SELECT group_name, toStartOfDay(created_at) AS day, avg(score) FROM evaluation_scores GROUP BY group_name, day`

## Exporting results

- **To dataset**: map columns to `data`, `target`, `metadata`.  
- **To labeling queue**: export via dataset, then queue for review.  
- **To dashboard**: save query and add it as a chart (line/bar/horizontal bar).
