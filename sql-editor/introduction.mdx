Laminar SQL Editor is a tool that allows you to write and execute SQL queries on your data stored at Laminar.

The main use cases for this are:
- Advanced analytics on your data
- Exporting any trace or evaluation result to a dataset

<Tip>
    The SQL Editor is currently in beta.
    Some functionality may change.
    We value your feedback and suggestions.
</Tip>

Laminar provides some useful syntactic sugar over standard PostgreSQL so that you don't
have to write explicit `join`s and you don't depend on our internal data model too much.

For detailed reference of the syntax, see the [reference](/sql-editor/reference) page.

<Tip>
    You can only access data from the current project in the SQL Editor.

## Features and benefits

- Write and execute SQL queries on your data stored at Laminar
- Filtering:
    - By date range
    - By span name and path
    - By span tags
    - By trace costs, metadata, duration, etc.
    - By evaluator scores
    - By evaluation results
- Fast analytics on your data, e.g.
    - Detailed breakdown of token count and cost by operation
    - Detailed latency analysis
- Exporting results to Laminar datasets or labelling queues

## Allowed queries and limitations

- Only `SELECT` queries are allowed.
- Allowed tables (to select from):
    - `spans`
    - `traces`
    - `evaluation_results`
    - `evaluation_scores`
    - `evaluations`
    - `datasets`

For detailed information about the tables and columns, see the [reference](/sql-editor/reference) page.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- You must have some data stored at Laminar, such as traces, evaluation results,
or datasets.

### Using the SQL Editor

In any page in your dashboard, click the Terminal icon in the top right corner.

You will see a sheet with an SQL editor.

### Example query

```sql
SELECT
    input,
    output,
    start_time
FROM spans
WHERE start_time BETWEEN now() - INTERVAL '3 days' AND now()
```

This query will return the input and output of the spans in the last 3 days.

For more examples, see the [examples](/sql-editor/examples) page.

### Viewing results

Results are displayed in a table or raw JSON view.

### Exporting results

Once you have selected the results you want to export, click the "Export to Dataset" button.

Choose the dataset you want to export to and map the columns to the dataset `data`, `metadata`, and `target` fields.
