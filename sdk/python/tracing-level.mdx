# Tracing Level

## Laminar.set_tracing_level(level)

Control what gets traced within a block.

```python
from lmnr import Laminar, TracingLevel

with Laminar.set_tracing_level(TracingLevel.META_ONLY):
    # Inputs and outputs NOT recorded
    # Timing, token counts, costs still recorded
    handle_sensitive_data()

# Normal tracing resumes here
```

**Levels:**

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `TracingLevel.ALL` | Trace everything (default) |
| `TracingLevel.META_ONLY` | Trace metadata only, no inputs/outputs |
| `TracingLevel.OFF` | Disable tracing entirely |
