description: Monitor production traces, users, cost, and performance

Laminar captures every production trace so you can debug implicit errors, track user behavior, and watch costs in real time. Use this section to read spans, add context, and visualize metrics.

- [Traces & Spans](/observe-in-production/traces-and-spans) for the core hierarchy and UI.
- [Sessions, Users & Metadata](/observe-in-production/sessions-users-metadata) to add context for filtering and analysis.
- [Browser Agent Observability](/observe-in-production/browser-agent-observability) to sync recordings with traces.
- [Cost & Token Tracking](/observe-in-production/cost-and-token-tracking) and [Custom Dashboards](/observe-in-production/custom-dashboards) to monitor spend and performance.
- [Image Tracing](/observe-in-production/image-tracing) and [Privacy & Tracing Control](/observe-in-production/privacy-and-tracing-control) to manage captured content.

Coming soon: AI trace compression to further optimize ingestion and storage.
