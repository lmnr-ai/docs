description: Read Laminar traces, spans, and the trace view
---

Laminar traces capture the full execution flow of your agent in production. Spans represent each operation—LLM calls, tool invocations, function calls—with inputs, outputs, timing, and errors.

## Span model

- **Name:** e.g., `gemini.generate_content`
- **Input/Output:** serialized parameters and return values (prompts and completions for LLM spans)
- **Duration:** execution time
- **Path:** hierarchical location (e.g., `get_user.validate.api_call`)
- **Attributes:** metadata such as model, provider, token counts, and cost
- **Lifecycle:** start → optional activation → end. Spans that never end do not appear in the UI.

## Trace model

A trace is the tree of spans for a single execution. Parent-child relationships show how the request flowed through your code and third-party libraries. Trace types include default application traces and evaluation traces.

## Trace view

- Tree of spans with timing bars
- Inputs/outputs and attributes per span
- Error events and stack traces where applicable
- Cost and token usage on LLM spans

Use manual instrumentation to shape the hierarchy, then explore spans here to debug and audit production behavior.
