description: Control what gets traced and handle sensitive data safely
---

Use tracing levels to control captured content and flush/shutdown tools to guarantee delivery in short-lived environments.

## Tracing levels

Choose how much data to record within a block of code:
- `ALL` – trace everything (default)
- `META_ONLY` – capture metadata without inputs/outputs
- `OFF` – disable tracing inside the block

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript/TypeScript">

```javascript
import { withTracingLevel, TracingLevel } from "@lmnr-ai/lmnr";

withTracingLevel(TracingLevel.OFF, () => {
  // code here is not traced
});

// normal tracing resumes here
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">

```python
from lmnr import Laminar, TracingLevel

with Laminar.set_tracing_level(TracingLevel.META_ONLY):
    # content is suppressed; metadata only
    pass

# normal tracing resumes here
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Use `META_ONLY` or `OFF` around sensitive operations, or switch to `ALL` to re-enable full capture.

## Flushing and shutdown

Laminar batches spans for performance. In short-lived scripts or serverless handlers, flush before exit to avoid losing data.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript/TypeScript">

```javascript
// End of your script
await Laminar.flush();    // ensure buffered spans are sent
await Laminar.shutdown(); // flushes and closes the SDK
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">

```python
# End of your script
Laminar.flush()     # send buffered spans
Laminar.shutdown()  # flushes and closes the SDK
```

For AWS Lambda and similar, use `Laminar.force_flush()` to block until spans are delivered:

```python
def handler(event, context):
    # your code
    Laminar.force_flush()
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>Do not flush on every web request in high-traffic servers; batching is optimized for production workloads.</Warning>
