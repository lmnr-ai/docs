Moving from experiments to production means tracing every LLM call, tool invocation, and agent step with minimal effort. Laminar instruments supported libraries out of the box, offers manual controls when you need precision, and can run in the cloud or self-hosted.

- [Automatic Instrumentation](/ship-to-production/automatic-instrumentation) wraps supported SDKs and frameworks with no code changes.
- [Integrations](/ship-to-production/integrations/) provide provider- and framework-specific setup.
- [Manual Instrumentation](/ship-to-production/manual-instrumentation) adds fine-grained spans, tags, and context propagation.
- [Self-Hosting](/ship-to-production/self-hosting) covers running Laminar yourself with access controls.
