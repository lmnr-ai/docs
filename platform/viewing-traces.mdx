The trace view supports multiple ways to explore the same trace: Tree, Timeline, and Reader (via the View dropdown), plus Metadata and Ask AI (via dedicated buttons/toggles). In any view, selecting a span opens the full span detail pane on the right.

## Tree View

### Open Tree View

1. Open a trace (from **Traces**).
2. In the trace view toolbar, open the view mode dropdown.
3. Select **Tree** (you can switch back the same way).

- **Hierarchy-first view**: Shows parent/child nesting so you can follow the trace’s call structure.
- **Collapsible branches**: Collapse spans with children to hide entire subtrees and reduce noise.
- **Inline metrics**: Duration on every row; tokens/cost badges on LLM spans.
- **Fast navigation**: Virtualized list stays responsive even on large traces.
- **Synced minimap**: Jump to spans quickly and scrub the shared session-time cursor.

Use Tree View when you want to understand structure: what called what, and where time/cost sits in the hierarchy.

## Reader Mode

Reader Mode gives you a readable, flattened view of a trace designed for fast scanning and review.

### Open Reader Mode

1. Open a trace (from **Traces**).
2. In the trace view header, open the view mode dropdown.
3. Select **Reader Mode** (you can switch back the same way).

- **High-signal view**: Shows only LLM and tool-call spans by default (other spans hidden), making the trace much easier to parse.
- **At-a-glance columns**: Type/model, timing, tokens/cost, and breadcrumbs per row.
- **Expandable rows**: Open any row to see formatted outputs; selecting still opens the full span detail pane on the right.
- **Lazy-loaded outputs**: Fetches only what’s on screen to keep the UI fast.
- **Templates per path**: Apply saved Mustache templates per span path to reshape how outputs render.
- **Synced minimap**: Highlights spans in view and lets you jump or scrub session time.

Use Reader Mode when you want a narrative, high-signal view of a trace focused on LLM + tool calls, without drilling through nested spans.

## Timeline View

### Open Timeline View

1. Open a trace (from **Traces**).
2. In the trace view toolbar, open the view mode dropdown.
3. Select **Timeline** (you can switch back the same way).

![Timeline view](/images/timeline-view.png)

- **Time-first view**: Renders each span as a colored bar on a single time axis.
- **Zoom controls**: Use +/- to zoom in for fine-grained alignment or out for a high-level overview.
- **Event markers**: Span events appear as ticks inside the bar.
- **Inline labels**: Name + duration (and tokens/cost for LLM spans) are shown on the bar when space allows.

Use Timeline View when you’re diagnosing latency, overlaps, gaps, or long-running steps.

## Metadata

### Open Metadata

1. Open a trace (from **Traces**).
2. In the trace view toolbar, click **Metadata**.

![Metadata view](/images/metadata-view.png)

- **Read-only source of truth**: Shows the trace metadata exactly as stored.
- **JSON-first**: Defaults to a JSON view with formatting and syntax highlighting.
- **Search/copy friendly**: Quickly find keys/values and copy raw text as needed.

Use Metadata when you need to verify context fields (inputs, run config, tags, custom attributes) without digging through spans. See [Metadata](/tracing/structure/metadata).

## Ask AI

### Open Ask AI

1. Open a trace (from **Traces**).
2. In the trace view toolbar, click **Ask AI**.

![Ask AI](/images/ai-view.png)

- **Automatic summary**: Generates a trace summary (and deeper analysis) to orient you quickly.
- **Span-aware answers**: When the assistant cites spans, they show up as clickable chips that jump you to the referenced span.
- **Iterate fast**: Ask follow-ups about errors, unexpected outputs, tool calls, or performance.
- **Resettable**: Start a new chat when you want a fresh thread.

Use Ask AI when you want a quick narrative explanation or guided debugging without manually scanning the whole trace.

## Open in SQL Editor

1. Open a trace (from **Traces**).
2. In the trace view header, open the **Trace** dropdown.
3. Select **Open in SQL editor** (opens in a new tab).

- **Pre-filled query (trace)**: Starts with `SELECT * FROM spans WHERE trace_id = ... ORDER BY start_time ASC`.
- **Pre-filled query (span)**: From a span’s detail header dropdown, **Open in SQL editor** creates `SELECT * FROM spans WHERE span_id = ...`.

Use SQL Editor when you need precise filtering, aggregation, or auditing on the raw spans table beyond what the UI exposes. See [SQL Editor](/platform/sql-editor).
