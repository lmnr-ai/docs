Live tracing lets you watch a trace fill in while it’s still running—spans show up as they finish, so you can debug long-running workflows without waiting for the root span to end.

## How to use it

1. Trigger a run that produces traces.
2. Open the trace in Laminar.
3. Keep the trace open—new spans will appear as they’re exported.

## Reduce delay (development)

Laminar batches spans for performance by default, which can add a small delay between a span ending and it appearing in the UI. For faster updates during development, disable batching:

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    import { Laminar } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';

    Laminar.initialize({
      projectApiKey: process.env.LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY,
      disableBatch: true,
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    from lmnr import Laminar

    Laminar.initialize(
        project_api_key="...",
        disable_batch=True,
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
Disabling batching increases export overhead. Keep batching enabled in production, and flush spans explicitly for short-lived processes. See [Flushing spans and shutting down](/tracing/structure/flushing-and-shutdown).
