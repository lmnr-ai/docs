Laminar includes full‑text search over span input, output, and flattened span attributes (so keys and values are searchable), scoped to your project and the current time range. Results are relevance‑ranked (and within a single trace, ordered by time).

Try searching for a phrase from a prompt/completion, or an attribute key/value like `user_id` or `123`.

- Search across prompts, completions, and span metadata to jump straight to the run you care about—no manual digging through traces.
- Fast, interactive search backed by a dedicated Quickwit inverted index, so you’re not scanning analytics tables as data grows.
- Refine instantly: limit search to inputs, outputs, or both, and narrow further with the same filters you use everywhere else.
- Time‑aware by default: search respects your selected time window, making it easy to find what changed in the last hour/day/week.
- Near‑real‑time: spans are indexed as they ingest, so new production traffic becomes searchable quickly.
