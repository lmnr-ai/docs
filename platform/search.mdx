Laminar search is a full‑text search over span input, output, and flattened span attributes (so keys and values are searchable), scoped to your project and the current time range. Results are relevance‑ranked (and within a single trace, ordered by time).

- Search across prompts, completions, and span metadata to jump straight to the run you care about—no manual digging through traces.
- Fast, interactive search backed by a dedicated Quickwit inverted index, so you’re not scanning analytics tables as data grows.
- Refine instantly: limit search to inputs, outputs, or both, and narrow further with the same filters you use everywhere else.
- Time‑aware by default: search respects your selected time window, making it easy to find what changed in the last hour/day/week.
- Near‑real‑time: spans are indexed as they ingest, so new production traffic becomes searchable quickly.
