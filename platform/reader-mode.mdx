# Reader Mode

Reader Mode gives you a readable, flattened view of a trace designed for fast scanning and review.

- **Flattened spans**: Lists spans top-to-bottom, LLM-centric sections first; default spans are hidden.
- **At-a-glance columns**: Type/model, timing, tokens/cost, and breadcrumbs per row.
- **Expandable rows**: Open any row to see formatted outputs; selecting still opens the full span detail pane on the right.
- **Lazy-loaded outputs**: Fetches only what’s on screen to keep the UI fast.
- **Templates per path**: Apply saved Mustache templates per span path to reshape how outputs render.
- **Synced minimap**: Highlights spans in view and lets you jump or scrub session time.

Use Reader Mode when you want a narrative, high-signal view of a trace without drilling through nested spans.
