Rollout sessions let you rerun long-running agents from the exact point you care about, without leaving Laminar.

## Why rollouts

When you are debugging long-running agents, three things slow you down:

- You need multiple tabs open to edit code, run it, and inspect execution.
- You wait a long time for the agent to reach the event you care about.
- The agent can take a different path and never hit that event at all.

Rollout sessions solve this by letting you cache up to a span, rerun from there, and inspect the new trace in the same page. Once the CLI is connected, you never have to leave the page.

## Setup

1. Wrap your main entrypoint with `observe` and set `rolloutEntrypoint: true`.

```typescript
import { observe } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';

export const generateStream = observe(
  { name: 'generateStream', rolloutEntrypoint: true },
  async (messages, model, modelId, reasoningEffort) => {
    // Your agent code here.
  }
);
```

2. Start the dev orchestrator: `npx lmnr-cli dev route/to/entrypoint.js`.
3. Open the session from **Rollout sessions** in your project.

<Note>
If the file exposes multiple rollout entrypoints, pass `--function` to select one.
Set `LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY` or use `--project-api-key` to connect.
</Note>

## Use in Laminar

1. Open **Rollout sessions** and select your session.
2. Pick a view (Tree, Timeline, or Reader). Use Search, Filters, and Metadata as needed.
3. Click **Cache until here** on an LLM span to reuse earlier outputs and jump ahead on the next run.
4. Edit **Parameters** or **System Prompts** in the left sidebar.
5. Click **Run**. New spans stream in and you can inspect them immediately.
6. Click **Stop** to cancel a run.

<Note>
You can edit your code while the CLI is running. Hot refresh keeps the rollout session alive so you can continue debugging without leaving Laminar.
