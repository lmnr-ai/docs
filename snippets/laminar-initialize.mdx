<Tip>
Laminar should be initialized once in your application. This could be 
at the server startup, or in the entry point of your application.
</Tip>

If `instrumentModules` is omitted, Laminar will auto-instrument supported SDKs that are
already loaded. For best results in Node.js, pass the SDKs you want to instrument
explicitly or call `Laminar.patch(...)` in the module where you construct your clients.

<Tip>
For Node.js setups, you should pass the modules you want to instrument, such as OpenAI,
or use `Laminar.patch(...)` if initialization happens before the SDK is imported.
See `instrumentModules` in the [SDK reference](/sdk/reference).
</Tip>

For more information, refer to the instrumentation section of the [SDK reference](/sdk/reference).
