<Tip>
Laminar should be initialized once in your application. This could be 
at the server startup, or in the entry point of your application.
</Tip>

This will automatically instrument all major LLM provider SDKs, LLM frameworks including
LangChain and LlamaIndex, and calls to vector databases.

<Tip>
For Node JS setups, you need to manually pass the modules you want to instrument, such as OpenAI.
See `instrumentModules` in the [SDK reference](/sdk/reference).
</Tip>

For more information, refer to the instrumentation section of the [SDK reference](/sdk/reference).
