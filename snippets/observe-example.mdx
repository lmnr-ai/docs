You can instrument specific functions by adding the `@observe()` decorator.
This is especially helpful when you want to trace functions, or group
separate functions into a single trace.

```python
from lmnr import observe

@observe()  # annotate all functions you want to trace
def my_function():
    res = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}],
    )
    return res.choices[0].message.content

my_function()
```

You can instrument specific functions by wrapping them in `observe()`. 
This is especially helpful when you want to trace functions, or group
separate functions into a single trace.

```javascript
import { observe } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';

const myFunction = observe(
  { name: 'myFunction'}, 
  async () => {
    const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4o-mini",
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What is the capital of France?" }],
    });
    return response.choices[0].message.content;
  }
);

await myFunction();
```

We are now recording `my_function` *and* the OpenAI call, which is nested inside it, in the same trace. Notice that the OpenAI span is a child of `my_function`. Parent-child relationships are automatically detected and visualized with tree hierarchy.

<div style={{ border: '1px solid #2B2B30', borderRadius: '8px', overflow: 'hidden' }}>
  <img src="/images/traces/trace-observe.png" alt="OpenAI span as a child" style={{ margin: '0px' }}/>
</div>

<Tip>
You can nest as many spans as you want inside each other. By observing both the functions and the LLM/vector DB calls
you can have better visualization of execution flow which is useful for debugging and better understanding of the application.
</Tip>

Input arguments to the function are automatically recorded as inputs of the span. The return value is automatically recorded as the output of the span.

Passing arguments to the function in TypeScript is slightly non-trivial. Example:

```javascript
const myFunction = observe(
  { name: 'myFunction'}, 
  async (param1, param2) => {
    // ...
  }
  'argValue1',
  'argValue2'
);
```
