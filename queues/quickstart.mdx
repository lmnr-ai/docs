## What is a Labeling Queue?

- A labeling queue is a collection of items that need to be labeled.
- Labeling queue is an actual queue with FIFO (first in, first out) order.
- Items in the queue have exactly the same shape as datapoints in a dataset.
- Labeling operation in this context means writing a data to the target field of a datapoint.

## How to Use the Labeling Interface

When you open a labeling queue, you'll see a split-screen interface designed for efficient labeling:

### Payload view
The left panel shows you the full JSON payload of the current item you're labeling.
Payload is a JSON object with the same shape as a datapoint in a dataset. It has `data` and `target` fields.


### Target Editor
This is where you do the actual labeling work:
- **Edit the JSON in the target editor** to correct, improve, or write new data to the target field.
- **Use proper JSON formatting** - the editor will help you with syntax highlighting

<Tip>
As you type in the target editor on the right, watch how the `"target"` section in the left payload updates in real-time. This helps you see exactly what will be saved to your dataset.
</Tip>


### Save Preferences  
- **Select your target dataset** from the dropdown to choose where completed items should go
- **Click "Complete"** to save the current item to the dataset and move to the next item in the queue.

### Navigation
- **Check the item counter** ("Item 5 of 11") to see how many items you've completed and how many remain
- **Use the navigation buttons** to move through your queue:
  - Click **"Skip"** if you want to pass on the current item without making changes
  - Use **"Prev"** and **"Next"** to move between items (helpful for comparing similar cases)
  - Click **"Complete"** when you're satisfied with your labeling

## Push items to the queue

### From Span View
You can push individual spans directly to a labeling queue for labeling.
This is particularly useful when you want to label specific model outputs for evaluation.
Span input will be added to the `data` field of the datapoint, and span output will be added to the `target` field.

<div style={{ border: '1px solid #2B2B30', borderRadius: '8px', overflow: 'hidden' }}>

</div>

### From Dataset View  
You can also push existing datapoints from datasets into a labeling queue.
You can either push individual datapoint or select a subset of datapoints in the dataset view.

<div style={{ border: '1px solid #2B2B30', borderRadius: '8px', overflow: 'hidden' }}>
<img src="/images/queues/push-from-datapoint.png" alt="Screenshot of a trace visualization" style={{ margin: '0px' }}/>
</div>





<Tip>
When pushing items to a queue, they maintain the same JSON structure as datapoints in datasets, ensuring consistency between your labeling workflow and final datasets.
