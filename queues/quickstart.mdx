Labeling queues let you turn raw outputs into labeled targets with a fast, focused UI. Push spans or dataset rows into a queue, label them, and write back to datasets for evals or training.

<Warning>
The current server build does not expose labeling queue APIs or UI. Keep this page bookmarked for when the feature ships; for now, use datasets directly for labeling workflows.
</Warning>

## What you'll do

- Queue items that share the dataset shape (`data`, `target`, `metadata`).  
- Edit targets quickly with a side-by-side payload + editor.  
- Save to a dataset in a single click; keep FIFO flow to stay organized.

## Fast path

1. From any trace span, click **“Send to labeling queue.”** Inputs become `data`; outputs become `target`.  
2. Open the queue; left pane shows payload, right pane is the target editor.  
3. Choose the destination dataset, click **Complete**, move to the next item.  
4. Use **Skip/Prev/Next** to navigate; item counter shows progress.

## Other ways to populate queues

- From a dataset: select rows and push them into a queue for review.  
- From SQL: export query results into a dataset, then queue them for labeling.

<Tip>
Queues preserve the dataset JSON shape, so labeled items drop straight back into evals without extra mapping.
