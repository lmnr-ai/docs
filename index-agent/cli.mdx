# Command Line Interface

Index provides a convenient command line interface (CLI) that allows you to interact with the browser agent through your terminal.

## Features

The Index CLI offers:

* Browser state persistence between sessions
* Follow-up messages with support for "give human control" action
* Real-time streaming updates
* Beautiful terminal UI using Textual

## Getting Started with CLI

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Index installed:

```bash
pip install lmnr-index

# Install playwright
playwright install chromium
```

### Running the CLI

You can run the CLI with the following command:

```bash
index run
```

Remember to set API key for the selected model in the `.env` file.

## Interactive Mode

When you run the CLI, you'll enter interactive mode:

{/* These dashes are actually ─ symbols in the terminal, they are just rendered weirdly in markdown,
so we replace them with a dash in the code block. */}

```

Agent is working...
Step 1: Opening lmnr.ai
Step 2: Opening Pricing page
Step 3: Scrolling for more pricing details
Step 4: Scrolling back up to view pricing tiers
Step 5: Provided concise summary of the three pricing tiers
```

## Model Selection

The CLI allows you to choose between different LLM models:

1. Gemini 2.5 Pro (default) - Best for complex reasoning tasks that require fast execution
2. Gemini 2.5 Flash - Good performance and fast execution, very cost effective
3. Claude 3.7 Sonnet - Best for complex reasoning tasks
4. OpenAI o4-mini - Good alternative with strong capabilities

## Browser State Persistence

The CLI automatically maintains browser state between sessions, which means:

- Login sessions are preserved
- Cookies are maintained
- Site preferences are remembered

This makes it convenient for tasks that require authentication or maintaining context across multiple runs.

## Stopping the Agent

You can exit the CLI at any time by pressing `Ctrl+C`.
