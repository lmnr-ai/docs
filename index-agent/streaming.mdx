# Streaming Agent Output

When running complex browser automation tasks, you may want to see the agent's output in real-time rather than waiting for the entire task to complete. Index provides streaming capabilities that allow you to see the agent's actions and thought process as they happen.

## Basic Streaming Example

Here's how to stream the agent's output:

```python
async for chunk in agent.run_stream(
    prompt="Navigate to news.ycombinator.com, find a post about AI, and summarize it"
):
    if chunk.type == "step":
        print(chunk.content)
    elif chunk.type == "final_output":
        print(chunk.content)
```

## Streaming in Interactive CLI

When you use the `index run` command to start the interactive CLI, streaming is enabled by default. This gives you real-time updates as the agent works, showing each step of the process:

```
Your message: go to lmnr.ai, summarize pricing page

Agent is working...
Step 1: Opening lmnr.ai
Step 2: Opening Pricing page
Step 3: Scrolling for more pricing details
Step 4: Scrolling back up to view pricing tiers
Step 5: Provided concise summary of the three pricing tiers
