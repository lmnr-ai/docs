title: Streaming output from Index browser agent
---

When running complex browser automation tasks, you may want to see the agent's output in real-time rather than waiting for the entire task to complete. Index provides streaming capabilities that allow you to see the agent's actions and thought process as they happen.

## Basic Streaming Example

Here's how to stream the agent's output:

```python
async for chunk in agent.run_stream(
    prompt="Go to news.ycombinator.com, find a post about AI, and summarize it"
):
    if chunk.type == "step":
        print(chunk.content)
    elif chunk.type == "final_output":
        print(chunk.content)
```
